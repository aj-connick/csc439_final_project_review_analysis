good I'm not a native Telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say I'm a fanboy.RRR bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film. The filmis three hours long but it never feel like it,the editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsThe film is casted perfectly Ram Charan has played his most wonderful character, NTR has restraint yet powerful presence to the film Alia Bhatt is graceful. All the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the Olivia moris. Ajay Devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the Film.The best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effects.The action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excuted.The film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or another.one of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years.

good Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi "here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of "f the Brits" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it's totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career! (If only Aamir Khan was here, 5 stars easy).
good A story about 2 individuals and their respective missions. Its has nothing to do with the India's independence and all....Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheema played by Ram Charan and Junior NTR had done an amazing performance. They just toiled for this movie...Visual Effects, Action Stunts, BGM was the highlighting factor as we focus only on story line it will be a disaster as these commercial elements is required to make the audience watch for 3hrs...Breath taking action sequences during the Hero's introduction, interval and at climax which we should definitely expect from a Rajamouli Film...Sabu Cyril production design was fantastic as he able to met the expectations of the director.Alia Bhat failed to impress whereas Ajay Devgn done his cameo performance very well...RRR is all of mass movie with high octane action sequences...The cinematography especially was fabulous as an it just able to say us "Whoaaa"Nattu Nattu song was just awesome as we could see the fast pace Junior NTR and Ram Charan doing their steps and that too with a proper coordination which just have to be experienced over a big screen..Overall its a visual impact treat which at PVR big screen or at Dolby Atmos can be watched.. That kind of efforts the team had put...So RRR a mass entertainer visual impact movie.
good Believe me after a long time a good movie come and you will enjoy every scene of this movie . Background music is awesome . Jr. NTR did best and ramcharan is also good . You fill goosebumps when they both come together.
good #OneWordReview...
good The greatest achievement is not making an industry defining franchise but to give the right follow up to it. Expectations are higher, challenges are higher and the chances of a misfire is at its highest. Visionary directors like Spielberg and James Cameron have proven it on the biggest stage but in Asian cinema, Rajamouli has established himself as the master of making magnum opus movies.The Bahubaali films aside from being box office behemoths, helped Telugu film industry to be popular across the country. Naturally, RRR is expected to reach that benchmark and it does largely to the fantastic lead performances from Ram Charan and Junior NTR. After multiple delays due to the pandemic, RRR hit screens at the right moment without compromising the post production work to hit the screens quickly.On a technical scale, it outdoes Bahubaali considerably. Even the unrealistic action sequences exhilirate you so well that you forget about the logic going out of the window. The criticisms of RRR is it's lack of screentime and proper writing for it's female characters. Like all Indian films it has the troupe of a damsel waiting to be rescued by our macho hero. While Junior NTR and Ram Charan play compelling leads it's tough not to wonder if they were playing The Hulk and Thor, considering they are unfazed by wild animals and bullet injuries.Ultimately RRR is a well made semi-fictional historical drama with the right amount "mass" movements to satisfy the audience. Rajamouli has clearly done his homework and has shown us again why he is the most consistent director in Telugu cinema.
good The tag SS Rajmouli is enough to watch the movie. Plz don't compare Rajmouli to other directors, SSR is a brandðŸ’¥.1st half will give you goose bumps in every scene. I'm tired of screaming in the theatre, Jr. NTR acting will make u stunned. Songs, dialogues are fabulous. Interval scene is beyond expectationðŸ”¥. Deadly combo of Ramcharan & Jr. NTR are fabulous, there fights & friendship is Top Notch.1st & 2nd half are carried perfectly, Rajmouli rocked it againðŸ’¥ðŸ”¥. They should've chosen other actress instead of Alia bhatt. Other actors like Ajay devgan, Shriya Saran, Olivia Morris & others rocked itðŸ’¥.Story, Cinematography, VFX, Dialogues, Action sequence, Songs, BGM everything is perfectly executed ðŸ”¥.RRR is a masterpiece ðŸ”¥
good Overall, RRR is probably Rajamouli career best since Bahubali frainchase. While it also became NTR and Ram Charan best film since Magadheera, Rangasthalam and Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava.Music is excellent and direction is great. Sure I think RRR going to set opening record.Definitely a must watch.
good If Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what S. S. Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film's two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the "main hero". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts. This is what cinema exists for, and you don't need to think too much before booking your tickets.
good The first Rajamouli film I saw was Magadheera. It was a revelation at that time for me that an Indian action film can look this good. The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called "pan-Indian" label.
good Now some audiences going to find logic, bcoz its clear when a good film release some ppl are looking for minus point only.For me it is the second true event film that i liked after 13 Hours. These days everyone doing based on someone life but from my side i have got only 3 hour to entertain myself and I can't regret for what i wasting my time. At this topic i only choose to entertain myself except to watch someone struggle in his/her time. I respect them all but i like to read a book about them not in film.Coming to the topic director did a brilliant job again and prove that he is the legend of indian cinema. Now some ppl will find logic, physic etc... Bcoz they don't know how to entertain themselves. Mostly from hindi audiences, by the way i m also a hindi but i like to praise someone hard work and any good films which entertain me anyway.
good I'd say the story is weak but mostly the film was entertaining, the action kept me gripped. I enjoyed the film thoroughly but the story could have been better.
good The first day back2back shows, first in Tamil 3D and the consecutive show in Hindi IMAX 3D.I think this is the 2nd best movie from the Telugu industry, just next to the same director's Baahubali 2.Story or plot-wise, there's nothing special but the making is where the film stands out.Visually very engaging, emotionally connecting and there's rarely a scene that is wasted, every single frame has been used.If you don't compare this to the director's previous films, then it'd be an amazing treat for sure and to some extent, it even goes beyond the expectations. Raajamouli is the only director who can do this magic repeatedly.The 2 protagonists' best movie is also this one only, I suppose.Certainly like other films, there are some cons but the pros surpass them easily as it was a refreshing experience watching a nice masala movie after a long time.
good This movie takes us to a world with emotional roller coaster ride, patriotism and strong characters. Every character has its own journey and a unique place in the story. I didn't expected VFX to be this good, I mean it was literally stunning to watch it in imax. The visual experience is what was very different from other movies.Overall this is an festival which should be celebrated by everyone.
good We all know it will be a blockbuster, but guys this is unexpectedly fantastic. Movie starts with fire & water introduction ,great approach by SSR. RC & NTR intro, their friendship are heart melting. I guess not even Hollywood or anyone can design this kind of intervel episode except SSR. Ajay episode is good. The scenes with Alia and NTR in pre climax make you roll out tears and the RC transformation to Alluri getup makes you clap in the theater. Wonderful experience. Movie wise it's greater than bahubali. Had chances to cross bahubali collection. 3d is also too good. Already watched 2 times 2d and 3d.
good Never reason before action best movie ever. Paisa wasul. Every penny of you is worth. Such a brilliant movie. Ntr ram Charan deadly combo is worth watching. Interval bang. Never saw such interval ever in Indian cinema. Nattu nattu song what a performance omg. Action scenes next level. SSR best ever director India have ever produced. Finally it's Indian cinema pride ðŸ˜
ok Watched it in 3d. Some scenes are like over the top and illogical. You don't expect this from Rajamaulis movie. There were some boring scenes as well. Story is not so trong. VFX is good. Some section scenes are also good. Overall, after Bahubali and Bahubali 2 Rajamauli disappointed me.
ok RRR (2022) :
good DOUBLE Best Acting N. T. Rama Rao Jr &
good First of all really good, mature acting by NTR jr. And Ram Charan. The scenes they are together, the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie.The production value made it very enjoyable to watch. The close up shots, the well made CGI all took this movie up some notches.Though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti British fetish. The commercial elements was seen everywhere but I guess that was intentional for mass audiences.It was great to experience it in 3D. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance.
good Maveric story teller Rajamouli hits out of the park again. Ram Charan is stunning in action and performance. NTR also good. Their bromance is a treat to watch. Don't miss this film at any cost.
bad Love is Gaspar Noe's latest film. It's essentially porn. Long, drawn out sequences of sex throughout. But there's a story, and that's what could be interesting about this film. Not since the early 70's has pornographic films experimented telling actual stories instead of just getting straight to business. Nymphomaniac is the last film of the modern era that attempted this, and it absolutely blew me away. This would've been fascinating, but instead, it's PAINFULLY boring. The story line and dialogue sucks. I didn't feel for anyone in this film. The acting was extremely stilted, but in porn films that's pretty much the norm. The cinematography is the only standout. It's beautiful to look at, as most Gaspar Noe films are. However, I despised the black screen that would appear every time there was a cut. As well as the many shots of the main character standing inside a doorway with his back turned to the camera, listening to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember.
bad As an erotic film, ticks all the boxes. The cinematography is vivid, However, the storyline is all over the place, the acting is lifeless, and the scene changes jarring.
bad Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using more expensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guys sitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie. "Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talking about. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and "artsy." It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother.
bad I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone.
bad Love, as it is titled, should be called Bored Whiny Man Child. This dirge clocks in at a whopping 2 hours and 15 minutes. I had to stop, walk away for a while and then return to watch this sniffling character act out his hypocrisy in such myopic detail. The relationship between the two principal characters is like oil and water. The only thing they share is a voracious appetite for sex, lots and lots of sex. The add a third person into the mix who winds up getting pregnant by the guy which leads to the main couple breaking up. Since they all were in a mÃ©nage Ã trois, that shouldn't have been an issue but it was. The female leaves him and we spend the rest of the film exploring his memories of her and him having more sex. They participate in orgies and he gets mad because she's having sex with other guys. He can had fun but she can't. If your life is nothing but the sex, why should that matter especially if he can participate and she can't? And there lies the quagmire with this presentation. This guy is totally immature. You become bored with him and with him having sex. Closeups of him with his exploding orgasms weren't shocking, innovative, wanted or move the picture along. After a while, you just want this story to just wrap up. You wonder what is the point? There is nothing redeeming about it. The other female character who has had his child is completely ignored. She is just another prop instead of exploring that dynamic of how they are dealing with a child together. Instead, we find his character crying in the bathtub with the toddler. And you have to ask yourself once again, the time he and his old girlfriend were together appears to be at least three years because you have to factor in the time the girl was pregnant and then you jump in time to see a toddler at least two years old. So why did his old girlfriend/s mother call him about her and why did he just started thinking about someone who hasn't been in his life for a long time? The writing was just poor. This guy was suppose to be some aspiring filmmaker. He is neither aspiring or making films and filming your naked girlfriend on a small video camera doesn't qualify you one bit. That aspect of the character was totally ignored as well. This was just bad. If you want to see if because of the unsimulated sex scenes, I would advise just watch some 5 minute porn clip and avoid this colossus time waster.
good 'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. 'Love' has many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the underlying story and to the director himself. Gaspar's mother is named Nora Murphy, while Murphy's son is named Gaspar and Electra's ex boyfriend - Noe. His favorite movie is Kubrick's '2001', while hers is Lang's 'M', both of which seem to fuel Murphy and Electra's behavior throughout the movie, where Murphy is often aimlessly overwhelmed with hope and desire, while Electra seems unable to forgive.Gaspar Noe constantly cuts through the past and the future, using the techniques he is so familiar with since Irreversible. The movie abruptly switches between various stages of Murphy's and Electra's relationship, always cutting back to the present, where Murphy's is in absolute emotional agony and despair, raising a child with Clara. At times Murphy and Electra are so deeply engrained in one another that their fights and dialogues seem outright comical and immature, as if we are observing a 16 year- old couple. But this is truly where 'Love' stands out. Being in love feels and looks exactly like this, it's raw, emotional and brutal yet foggy and sweet; when no one else exists or matters.In one of Electra's and Murphy's conversations they talk about the sad reality that they are going nowhere and dragging each other down, they discuss taking a break. It is an extremely sad and emotional scene, where the thought itself brings so much fear into them, that they simply end up holding each other even tighter.The script for 'Love' is only 7 pages long. It is full of beautiful and weird dialogues and extremely emotional, 'free-played' graphic scenes. These scenes however are not there to impress the viewer or open the doors to the unknown. This is also not a nymphomaniac-like sexual exploration. Gaspar Noe does a masterful job in showing us the true emotional aspect of love, in it's raw and relatable form, sex.The sound-score is stunning, with the music gradually changing depending on the mood and the context of the scenes. Even though a lot of times it seems like we are watching the same people 'fuck' in the same positions, different context, feelings and music make each of these scenes truly unique and mesmerizing on it's own. Noe also does a wonderful job in his minimalistic depiction of the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes.
ok I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admit this film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it.
bad Porn disguised as an artsy love story. 95% of the movie was sex and the rest was going to clubs, drinking, and drugs. Did these people even have jobs? Do yourself a favor and watch a porno. At least they have plots.
good The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, NoÃ© takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing ("finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond.
ok Had potential...but wastes it on cheap publicity stunts and a plot that goes nowhereA man, Murphy, is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a woman he doesn't love. The couple also have an unplanned young son, adding to Murphy's feelings of being trapped. He starts to think of his previous girlfriend - Electra, how perfect everything was, and how and why everything fell apart. Then he learns that she has disappeared...The movie had potential. The intrigue of the disappearance of Electra, the regret that their (perfect) relationship didn't work out, the suffocating relationship he is currently in, his depression over where everything has ended up - these all made for some interesting potential paths for the movie.But, alas, it was not meant to be.None of these threads go anywhere. In the end, nothing is resolved and there is no point to the whole long exercise. And, yes, it is a long exercise - 2 1/4 hours, with about half of that made up of padding. So many scenes which add nothing to the movie, and just make you more bored.From the start you know it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair - the pacing is slow from the beginning - but you hope to be rewarded with something profound at the end. No such luck.What the movie will be most remembered for is its explicit sex scenes. While not really that new anymore (Nine Songs, anyone?), many of the scenes are just there for shock / controversy / publicity value. Sad to see that Gaspar Noe has ended up making pretentious crap like this. Irreversible was brilliant and heralded Noe as director to be followed. However, since then he hasn't made a decent movie. His previous movie, Enter the Void, was even more pointless and pretentious than Love. He is turning out to be a one-hit wonder.
bad "Love" opens with the kind of sex scene that was once only seen in hard-core porn but which now seems to be the norm in mainstream cinema. Needless to say, if hard-core porn isn't your bag or indeed the films of Gaspar Noe, perhaps it's best you give "Love" a miss. Indeed, if you enjoy the pleasures cinema usually offers then I would give "Love" a miss too. Noe is, of course, a master of controversy and his films are famous for both explicit sex and violence. They also tend to be visually imaginative but badly written and acted and "Love" is no exception, except perhaps that it's even more badly written and acted than most.With a title like "Love", of course, you might think the violence level will be minimal and you'd be right but "Love" isn't so much concerned with love, (the word is used a tad too often for my liking), but sex and lots of it and in 3D, too. This is a two-and-a-quarter hour porn movie but if it's porn you're after, just ditch this rubbish and stick with the real McCoy. Not that I needed proof, but this sure proves Noe is probably the most overrated director alive.
bad It is a 2:04 hours movie.Take out all the scenes where they present you with genitalia and you have a bit over one hour left. If it was a philosophical movie, perhaps there would be a part of the sex sequences that carried more meaning - but there is no such relief in this movie.We are presented with a stereotypical immature, selfish, arrogant, possessive young male studying cinema in Paris - apparently only to get stoned and laid. He meets this sweet, proactive, sexually empowered young woman that also enjoys drugs. Not the least stereotypical, as she falls for him with deep and unbridled love. His love is also deep but he is the villain here, so he get as many other women as the time not having sex with his official one allows.She notices it (who wouldn't, at this rate?) and tells him she also has had her escapades. He makes scene after scene, including beating up her lover (an ex- boyfriend). He tries to bully a police officer inside a police station.She stands by him in another stereotypical situation.Then this monster gets the pretty blonde underage neighbour girl pregnant. This is where she draws the line. Notwithstanding the fact that she was the one that suggested they get another woman in bed. Despite the fact that she made the move to invite the blondie.Then she goes down into a spiral of drugs and alcohol, shutting him off her life completely.Once more, stereotypes.He keeps the blondie, they have a little boy (that he names after the child he and the lost love dreamt to have together - stereotype, anyone?) and, as he drags himself in a pool of self-pity and despair (which does not go unnoticed by said blondie), comes the news that the original girl has been missing for a couple of months.Then he spends a full day calling people to try and find her. In the meanwhile, blondie leaves with the boy, telling him to finish his past so they could have a future.Obviously, he doesn't find her - which doesn't preclude his opium- induced dreams of her to interrupt all the time.There is a very awkward scene with him and the child in the bathtub, after blondie's face tells us she will leave him.And the movie ends with him and original girl embraced under the shower professing endless love and protection.Oh! Did I mention that it is partly filmed backwards, as 'Irreversible' was? By the way, they used a very similar setting - an underground passage - in one of the sequences. Check it out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Or that this theme of intense, destructive, drugged and short-lived love was way better portrayed in 'More'? Also, a good part of the soundtrack comes from Pink Floyd.... See it: (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064694/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2In other words, apart from all the sex, this is a derivative, shallow and unworthy movie...The '3' I gave the movie is for photography and soundtrack. Really good in all scenes, conveys mood and context.The rest is crap.
ok ... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director "falls in love" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe went where angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, for posterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel.
bad Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that was quite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has been my iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy and trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the Warmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in your face trippy films.
bad are these people crazy or what i mean what in the blue hell is this how is this even called a film & how did it get released i like erotic films but this is just pure garbage.love 2015 is a desperate attempt by the makers to sell porn in the name of art sadly it fails.love is a wrong title this film should have been called lust,films like these that justify wrong things in society should be banned.this is some sick fantasy or a pervert thats it there is no story in this film just sex and vulgarity what can you say about a film that opens with a hand job scene that lasts for 5 minutes.after watching this filth my reaction was crazy i wondered for a long time about what was the reaction of people who saw this in the theaters,can you imagine only.the main characters are biggest cheats ever the whole 2 hours they are having sex,clubbing & then more sex.the camera-work is lousy,music sucks & acting oh please don't ask all of the actors were terrible.i am believing for once second that someone actually wrote a script for this nonsense.if you want a better film try some of those Shannon Tweed soft core movies from 90s decade or if you want hardcore simply buy porn but stay away from this stupidity.Love 2015 has nothing to see if you enjoy crass cheap cinema then this is for you my rating is 1/10,its a waste of time and money.Skipp it
ok While I didn't try to think of the song, the line "Baby don't hurt me ... don't hurt me no more" came to mind. And it's not like it doesn't suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let's get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn't or don't already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you'll see everything of them in this. It's not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It's about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can't have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their "world" view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...
bad It put me to sleep on one of those night that my insomnia reared its ugly head. Not sure why this movie was made because it was neither entertaining nor informative nor thought provoking. It was actually boring from the fist scene to the last. That took some talent I guess.
ok I always have problems with beginnings â€“ the beginning of an article, the beginning of a film, the beginning of a relationship, simply because beginnings are crucial in setting the tone and pattern that will lead you all the way through till the end. Naturally being affected by all the negative social media propaganda that Gaspar NoÃ©'s Love (2015) has stirred, I was reluctant to even begin watching it because I am inclined to believe that films with explicit sexual content (except for Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac, and I will tackle why in another review) are made either to sell like cheap porn for lucrative reasons or to assume a false air of originality and experimentation. I have finally decided to watch Love after it was recommended by a trusted friend of mine, and at the end of the day, one has to constantly push their limits in terms of artistic tolerance.Back to the beginnings, Love begins with a three-minute scene taken in one shot by a steady camera of two people having what seems to be â€“ and what actually turns out to be â€“ unsimulated sex. After overcoming my feelings of discomfort, I started to understand what the Argentinian director is trying to do here. Is it a pornographic scene? It definitely is. But is it meant to be sexually arousing? I would have to argue for a no. Sexual excitement requires a certain amount of build-up, but jumping directly and unexpectedly into the act generates nothing but feelings of shock and unease that would need some time to fade away.The story then unfolds in a backward linear plot. We are introduced to Murphy (the man in the opening sex scene), a frustrated young man who lives in a small apartment in Paris with his detached girlfriend and their son. The memory-evoked reversed narrative is instigated by a voice message he receives from the mother of his ex-girlfriend Electra (the woman from the opening sex scene), asking for his help to find her daughter. The man and the woman from the first sex scene are no longer strangers; we get to see how they broke up, how they managed their relationship, and finally how they met, with a heap of very long unsimulated sex scenes in between.As a voyeur (a person who discreetly watches other people in intimate, usually sexual, positions) I was extremely confused since the enjoyment element was missing. Is it because the sex scenes were too many, too long, too real, or too unnecessary? In one of the scenes Murphy says, as a cunning gesture to voice Gaspar NoÃ©'s desire, his biggest dream is to make a movie like no other that truly portrays sentimental sexuality. He also tells Electra: "I want to make movies out of blood, sperm and tears. This is like the essence of life. I think movies should contain that, perhaps should be made of that." Well, we see a lot of sperm and tears in that film, there is no doubt about it. It is true Love depicts relationships from an exceptionally crude, raw angle I have never seen before. Sex in cinema â€“ and in life in general â€“ is an uncanny subject; it lies at the essence of everything, everybody knows it is there, yet nobody talks about it overtly.. not in realistic terms at least. The film feels emotionally real. Too real. And not just when it comes to sex, but also to dialogue and performance. In one scene, Murphy tries to get Electra back and he keeps knocking on her door, after a few seconds she opens the door, apparently under the influence of drugs, and screams at him in the most deranged manner you could ever imagine. The camera does not move; it feels like a terrified neighbor watching the scene from the stairs. Most of the camera movement and angles follow the same pattern throughout the movie: the neutral uninvolved medium shot. Mid-film I realized it was not the sex scenes that made me uncomfortable but the fact that the film is devoid of any cinematic, stylistic euphemisms. In conventional romantic films, there is an invisible line separating the romantic from the sexual â€“ love from desire. The subtle message is always: love is sublime and desire is vulgar. The reality of the things, and as presented in the film, is that both are inseparable in their sublimity and vulgarity.I cannot tell for sure whether I like it or not. Cinema, as Slavoj ÂŽiÂžek puts it, is "the ultimate pervert art" because it does not directly satisfy our desires but manipulates them. It does not show us our capabilities, but give us the illusion that we are capable. Cinema draws the line between imagination and reality and keeps crisscrossing the boundary: it takes imaginary elements and roots them in reality, and sugarcoats real elements in imaginary wraps. The trick is not to call a spade a spade, i.e. not to place two firm feet on one side of the spectrum; otherwise you would shake the balance between reality and imagination that the viewer cannot find in real life.Whatever your sentiments are towards the film, NoÃ© â€“ purposefully or inadvertently â€“ raises some important issues: what if cinema does away with the aesthetics of presentational euphemism? Would it undermine its role as an artistic medium? Would it put the viewer on the defensive, being constantly faced with the unrefined reality of what (s)he dreads/desires?The way I see it is that NoÃ© created an extremely stimulating film, not sexually as he probably desired but intellectually and sentimentally.I'm grateful I watched Love alone and had the chance to struggle with and make sense of all those feelings and thoughts by myself. I can imagine how uncomfortable it would be watching it in a movie theater with other people, let alone how the actors felt while shooting!
ok Set in France, 'Love' is one of those arty films that features explicit sexual activity. Director Gaspar NoÃ© reportedly said he wanted to create a film featuring a 'love story seen from a sexual point of view'; did he succeed?The film opens with American student Murphy getting a handjob from French girl Electra while he in turn fingers her - um - front bottom. This all seems very nice, but flash forward a few years and we see Murphy living unhappily with a different Frenchwoman (Omi), the mother of his young child. How he got from pleasant afternoon handjobs to dissatisfied (though responsible) domesticity forms the narrative of the film.There's a heavily improvised feel - and not just in the sex scenes: the more routine conversations are well played, but the frequent arguments/shouting matches are unfocused and boringly repetitive. Lead actors Karl Glusman, Aomi Muyock and Klara Kristin - the latter two apparently never having acted before being cast in this film - are competent (when they're not shouting). Muyock, especially, does a creditable job in showing Electra's rapid descent from wholesome student to attention-seeking slapper. The sex scenes are not the cold affairs some reviewers report them to be: true, they're not the height of eroticism, but they're enjoyable enough, with all three leads looking attractive sans clothes.And although the film being shot in 3D didn't add anything for me, I have to admit it made for an unusual money shot...
bad This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour art film. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every single shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality, there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well, these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy giving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is the sex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent a porno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to deal with this horribly made 'film'.
ok I don't really know what to think. Would never let myself say this film was bad, it really wasn't in terms of cinematography. But what is good cinematography with a crap story. This is my problem with Noe, if only he could have a good screenwriter, sometimes I think. The style and leaps of time are still very attractive to me. It seems that the whole film is a stream of consciousness of Murphy. But honestly, I hated the female actress for the role, whoever she was, I thought the casting was done very poorly.After watching irreversible, Love was considerably weaker and worse. Again, the use of color was something... remarkable, the editing, the pacing, everything in terms of production were great. But I keep realizing that great production with a bad story does not have much value.
bad I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDb description says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong with Electra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The movie should have been called "Borderline Personality Disorder". The writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an (expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for his mindless violence - "I'm an American an we fight for what's ours blah blah" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him - what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded pillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abomination deserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sex scenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this would be a career ender for all involved.
bad I clicked on this film accidentally on Netflix, and was intrigued with the plot premise and the shocking opening scene of sex. Continued watching and found that this movie was titillating but only on the most superficial level. The constant and long sex scenes actually got boring. The threeway sex scene was actually annoyingly staged and filmed. The actors were all pretty, yet none of them pulled off demonstrating realistic impressions of orgasming.I think Murphy is an overt representation of the director himself, especially when Murphy said he wanted to film a movie about "sentimental sexuality." Yet later in the film, Murphy tears Electra's whole life to shreds verbally, saying the most vile, relationship-ending things he could about her to her. That's love ? How is that a view of sentimental sexuality ? Murphy degrades as a person and boyfriend throughout the film, becoming repulsive (not that he was impressive from the beginning either.) Then, after Electra and him are long over, after he abused her mentally and drove her away, after he obsessed about and stalked her, then he's a pathetic baby wishing he still had her. So much for the guy who says he's not going to be ruled by (his desire for female parts.) This film should have been called "Toxic Masculinity" because that's what it truly represents: how a man can worship a woman as his ideal sexualised object, and then absolutely stomp on her self-esteem and person verbally and emotionally. Surprised he didn't try to beat her, too. How is it sentimental when the entire film, he worships her in retrospect (and apparently for real during the beginning of their relationship) but then throws it away in an instant when Electra goes out of town for some sex with Omi ? The most chilling thing about the film is, how he almost could have gotten away with it, had the condom not broke, had Omi not gotten pregnant. But then again, how stupid can you be when having sex with your immediate neighbor in the building, and expecting her to keep the secret anyways?? This film accomplishes the opposite of what it maybe intended. It doesn't illuminate "love" at all. It makes men look like narcissistic who just want to own women and push them around. Sorry, that's not love in my book. But what I despised the most was sitting through the entirety of this dragging, anti-erotic film, only to have NO idea at the end what actually happened to Electra. Seriously made me sit through this narcissistic drivel, for that ???
good Honestly, this is the first movie I ever watched from this director and I am amazed. I found his name by searching for directors similar to Nicolas Winding Refn.To get right to it, the opening scene is a little shocking but its cause I'm an american and used to movies not showing that stuff right off the bat. But it wasn't anything to get freaked out or something that would make me walk out of the theater.Once you get over the fact that it is sex then you start to analyse the scenes. Notice how Electra doesnt seem entirely there in the threesome. He is more into the other girl than her. I took this as a foreshadowing moment which this director did a lot of in the movie. Notice how its always sex with the two of them.Something that struck me was he always used the phone while standing in a doorway. This is another element to his character. It reveals a lot about their relationship as a hole.The music score is great and I picked up on the Pink Floyd songs. Another great attempt at foreshadowing.But, the one thing that really got me was the use of colours. Notice the red green orange and yellow that pops up from time to time. I believe red means pain, orange means love, green is fear and yellow is shy. The scene at the party where he messes around with the girl in the bathroom. Notice how the entire room is red and the bathroom is green. He is afraid at first to mess around with the girl because of Electra. But if you paid attention the scene prior when the two were talking to each other in front of Electra, they were in a red room and you couldn't help but feel the pain from electra as she had to watch him flirt.The entire movie is really about his narcissism and it plays well. I'd really like a sequel in which its in her point of view. To watch the same scenes over but get her thoughts would really make this come full circle.
good Writer-director Kenneth Branagh tells a semi-autobiographical story. Young Jude Hill is playing in the street outside his row house, when suddenly Protestant gangsters march through and smash every Catholic household's windows, rip up the paving stones, and drive everyone, Catholic and Protestant alike to refuge. Soon the British Army is setting up occupation of the street, as the neighbors help each other, and Hill's immense extended family, presided over by grandfather CiarÃ¡n Hinds and grandmother Judi Dench seem to take everything in stride. But there's family problems as well as religious ones.This movie reminded me of 2018's Roma, an important moment in history through the eyes of a boy filtered through the adult sensibilities of the film maker.... but without the extreme deep-focus camerawork that kept me wondering when we were going to start telling another story. Branagh gives us visual fireworks, with the attack on the street shown from young Hill's perspective, with a double-360-degrees panorama in slow motion.In the end, the story is less about flashy camerawork or the religio-political uproar of the times, but how a loving, committed, decent family gets on with life, raising children, earning a living, and loving each other. Most stories about love are about the big events, the flashy events. This one shows us the day-to-day of love while everyone else is worrying about the big events.
ok To some it would come as a surprise that Kenneth Branagh is from Northern Ireland.He never hid the fact that his family moved to Britain once the Troubles started in the late 1960s.Once they arrived Branagh had to modify his Irish accent to fit in.The semi autobiographical Belfast expands on the forces that drove Branagh's parents to take the momentous step to move away from their homeland.Starting off in colour, it moves into black and white. Buddy is playing with other children in his neighbourhood. It is 1969 and both Protestants and Catholics live on the same street.Suddenly shocking violence erupts, a Protestant mob wants to force the Catholics out.In this turmoil, Buddy's dad who works as a carpenter in London contemplates moving to the mainland. Not helped by the financial woes over a tax demand.For Buddy it also means leaving behind his grandparents and the girl he fancies at school.For his dad, he is being pressurized to choose sides. It is no coincidence that one of the movies the family watches at the cinema is High Noon.The Troubles is now mainly consigned to history. I speak to my children in the past tense as to my experience of growing up during the IRA bombing campaign ranging from the 1970s to the 1990s.There was always a danger that visiting a city centre in the mainland during Christmas meant the risk of some kind of car bomb suddenly going off. In fact there was a day when I was stuck in a traffic jam meaning I was delayed getting to place that was earlier blown up by an IRA bomb.Belfast has been called nostalgic, having a thin plot. It is life affirming but does not shy away from the turmoil. It is framed in a child's viewpoint, wonderfully played by Jude Hill.The events of the film are still relevant. Brexit has placed dangers on the Good Friday Agreement. The present Tory government is cynically playing fast and loose with it. The impact of the Troubles must never be forgotten.
good Greetings again from the darkness. Despite Irish ancestry, during my childhood, Ireland was vaguely described as a place to avoid due to the Northern Ireland Conflict (also known as The Troubles). In contrast, the childhood of writer-director Kenneth Branagh was smack dab in the middle of this political and religious mess. This autobiographical project is a sentimental look back at his youth and the connection to his career as a filmmaker. This is very attractive and appealing filmmaking, and one that acknowledges the violent atmosphere without dwelling on it.An opening aerial view of present day Belfast shipyards in full color abruptly transitions back to black and white 1969. A young boy plays and skips cheerfully as he makes his way through the apparently idyllic neighborhood. The pleasantries are shattered and give way to the frenzied fear and havoc created by an approaching angry mob. The native Protestants' goal is to push out all Catholics from the area. The happy young boy we first see is Buddy (played by newcomer Jude Hill), the stand-in for Branagh as a child. While watching, we must keep in mind that we are seeing things unfold through Buddy's eyes - which are actually the eyes of a middle-aged director looking back on his upbringing. This explains the sentimentality and nostalgia, two aspects handled exceedingly well.Buddy and his older brother Will (Lewis McAskie) live with their parents Ma (Caitriona Balfe, FORD V FERRARI, "Outlander") and Pa (Jamie Dornan, "The Fall"), and are close with Granny (Oscar winner Judi Dench) and Pop (Ciaran Hinds, one of the finest supporting actors working today). Pa spends much of his time away in London working as a carpenter, leaving Ma parenting diligently to create normalcy for the boys during tumultuous times. An added stress is the financial woes Ma and Pa face over tax debt. Granny and Pop are an endearing elderly couple still very much in love, despite their constant needling and bickering.As things escalate, the division over religion becomes more prevalent. Although he attempts to stay out of the fracas, Pa is faced with the "either with us or against us" decision - something he avoids as long as possible. Ma is obsessed with keeping her boys on the straight and narrow, despite their naivety and the many forces pulling them away. The family finds its emotional escape at the local cinema, which treats us to clips of bikini-clad Raquel Welch in ONE MILLION YEARS BC; Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper facing off with a similar 'stay or go' dilemma in HIGH NOON; John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE; and Dick Van Dyke in his flying car from CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG. The sense of awe and wonder is laid on a bit thick for effect, but it helps us connect young Buddy with present day Branagh.It's quite a family dilemma. How do you decide to pack up and leave the only town you've ever called home, and when do you make that decision? When does the danger and turmoil pose too much to risk for your kids? There is a fun scene that provides young Buddy a lesson on how to answer, "Are you Protestant or Catholic?" It plays comically but has a serious undertone. Speaking of Buddy, newcomer Jude Hall in his feature film debut, uses his sparkling eyes and an engaging smile to light up the screen. His adolescent pining for Catherine (Olive Tennant), the smart girl in his class, is worthy of the price of admission. All of the actors are terrific, and in addition to young Mr. Hall, it's Caitriona Balfe (as Ma) whose performance really stands out. Award considerations should be in her future.Filmmaker Branagh has assembled a crew of frequent collaborators, including cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, who works wonders with the monochromatic scheme. The soundtrack is chock full of Van Morrison songs - it is Ireland, after all, and the overall feeling is that this is a film Branagh needed to make in order to deal with his childhood prior to his family relocating to England. By not avoiding The Troubles, yet not focusing on it, Branagh has told his story in a personal way that should be relatable to many. It's a terrific film.BELFAST opens in theaters on November 12, 2021.
good Belfast is a phenomenal drama that's really funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking whilst also feeling deeply personal for writer/director Kenneth Branagh. A film that's easily one of his best.Jude Hill gives an incredible lead performance full of the necessary warmth, joy and adorable naivety. Caitriona Balfe gives the standout performance and Jamie Dornan finally has a role that shows what he can really do. Judi Dench and CiarÃ¡n Hinds are wholesome scene stealers.Kenneth Branagh's direction is outstanding, consistently beautifully framed with every single one looking amazing with the transition from colour to black and white really working. The soundtrack is great and adds a lot to the more emotional moments.
good What was it Mike Nichols once said, a film is like a person and either you trust it or you dont? I think that could be said for Belfast but I thought of it more about a kind of personality that a filmmaker brings to a work as well as the cast and everyone else involved, and on that note Belfast to me is a total sweetheart of a movie, where it has many moments where it's quite cute and charming, but it's always based around the fact that this family is doing their best and more or less succeeding in caring for one another and (as Dornan's dad points out towards the end to the little boy when he asks about if a Catholic can be with a Protestant) what the basic power of kindness can do.It's a film that manages the feat of having sentiment and even some sentimentality, but earning it throughout because (outside of maybe the bookends where the "Troubles" and all that horrible violence in the streets comes knocking) it doesn't cheapen what the stakes are or what these characters are going through. The basic question of "staying or leaving" is not one we haven't seen before in other films, and I'm sure we'll see again, yet Branaugh as writer/director gives the people here this honesty that is a family that is there together and there is this struggle (mostly for dad) to keep it together.This is beautifully rendered as well with this point of view coming from the little boy (standing in for Branaugh at that time I can assume but as with like Roma who knows) as he peers in on these arguments and conversations that have a repetition that isn't repetitive, if that makes sense. If you've been in a family that has money problems, this is just the way it is, and Dornan and especially Balfe have this chemistry that works perfectly.Another thing in its favor: you think the little boy Buddy (played by Jude Hill) will be cute and his interactions with others, especially the grandparents (good lord do Dench and Hinds, the latter I hope gets an Oscar, steal every scene they're in) could get tiresome, but Branaugh manages to keep him engaging and this mix that's hard to describe where he's universal and specific, like you don't even have to be a little boy just like at some time if you were young and trying to figure out a world that has so much stuff in it and there's the escape of movies and the wonder of astronauts alongside the horror of men in the streets throwing molotov cocktails... OK that part isn't everyone's experience, but there's little things Branaugh gets so right as a writer; my favorite is when his older cousin ropes him in as part of a "gang" initiation to steal something from the local sweet shop. How that resolves itself is ::chefs kiss::This whole thing reminds me of like what if you took one of those stories of childhood via Frank McCourt (or Malachy, one of those) and imbued it with a lot more warmth and a generosity of spirit, and it's in general a difficult movie to dislike or be too hard on without sounding like a grouch without any feelings. At the same time, I am critical of how the film opens and comes to a climax inasmuch as the "Troubles" set pieces are shot and presented in this tremendous manner that, of course, are impossible to ignore as far as the history at the time in Ireland and that city as a wholeBut it can't help but feel like... this is where it's a MOVIE in large letters, shot in an intense style like this is where it all becomes so overwhelming, which makes sense given the POV of this boy, and at the same time it loses that intimacy you have throughout the rest of the film, where it's power is in showing life's little moments having even more of a lasting impact. Also, with the one supporting character trying to force the Dad to pick a side as the one person I didn't quite believe (not the actor so much as the character, kind of one note you know). As a small technical aside, as much as I like Branaugh's eye for compositions (both usual and unusual, his framing is off in interesting ways), the digital quality of it all is distracting for me, and I wish this was shot on film for that crisper look.All that doesn't take away from the pathos that is all here, with humor that works because it's based around like how much we may have enjoyed being around people like this in our families. Is it idealized? I don't know, but it doesn't come across as that, if anything it shows that the human soul and spirit can be resilient and this is a lesson for kids all over but also ones for the adults, too. How is one any *good* in a family? Hard to say, except it comes down to being there and not giving up. That's the kind of tone Belfast has, and it is filled with little grace notes - one that I'm sure to remember is when Dench's grandma tells the grandpa before he has to go to the hospital that she will go with him by bus and take him in and stay with him till its all done and then take him home. She doesn't state it in any way that sounds false, and none of (admittedly very good) Van Morrison music to score this beat. It's just two people who have a love that is self evident by actions.So, in short: a sweet-heart of a movie, not to mention last but certainly not least that this is a fun time of expressing how remembering history through some pop-culture filtering can be entertaining and insightful (High Noon song, anyone?)
ok A very solid if unremarkable coming of age film set during the Irish troubles of 1969.This movie was very reminiscent of the 1987 film "Hope and Glory," only that film was much better. In fact, this movie reminded me a lot of the kinds of films that came out in the late 80s and throughout the 90s, accomplished and pleasing Oscar bait movies that gave not especially sophisticated adult film audiences products that were good and substantial enough to make them feel like they were seeing something important but safe enough to never make them feel challenged or threatened.For me, what gave "Belfast" its heart was not the central story about a little boy and the parents who want to give him a better life than war-torn Ireland allows, but rather the side story about the enduring love between his grandparents, played by Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench. The best scenes in the movie were the ones featuring those two, and Dench's scene at the end is the one that lingered with me most. I was thrilled to pieces when both of them were recognized with Academy Award nominations.Grade: A-
ok "If they can't hear you, then they're not listening."Kenneth Branaugh's Belfast is an autobiographical account from his childhood. It depicts a story about a young boy and his working class family experiencing the tumultuous late 1960s in the hometown of Belfast. I'm going to say it, I've never been taken away by Branaugh's direction in the past. He's a great actor and all, but when it comes to filmmaking, everything I've seen from him has either just been okay or disappointed. Maybe it's because he's never made something as personal as this. Though I don't think it's as wonderful as everyone makes it out to be, I did find myself enjoying Belfast. It manages to create a story centered around family and what it feels like to be a child growing up in a place that's dear to you. With the story being almost auto-biographical, you see the world as Branaugh did. It's a fun and lovely story, even if it touches on heavier subjects like loss and riots. I found the screenplay to be written well. Honestly, this movie could very well be considered a comedy. It's full of humor and light. Still, it can play out a bit melodramatic, especially the end. The ending for me was a little abrupt. I was told there was going to be a scene full of emotion to make everyone cry, but that moment passed and it was the end. I'm glad it ended on that note instead of Branaugh's original ending which had a documentary sort of thing going on and him returning to Belfast. Luckily we have editors to cut things out.What made the movie, at least for me, were the performances. With the likes of Caitriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, Judi Dench, and CiarÃ¡n Hinds you're in for some great acting. Dench and Hinds have smaller performances than the others but play the perfect grandparents you'd want. Dornan, and though we've known he's a better actor than his work in the 50 Shades series, is great and has a lot of fun with his more serious role that does get to have some fun. The absolute best comes from Balfe. She's the best part of the whole movie. For me, she was that part that made the movie most emotionally gripping. And then there's Jude Hill who is the only lead. He may be whiny and that irritating kid sometimes, but he sees the world as a new adventure everyday which is always pleasant to watch. As his first major role and at such a young age, I believe he did a good job. Branaugh set out to make a movie that would possibly win him awards and be the crowd pleaser of the year. Personally, I don't think his direction was all that amazing. He does a good job, but it felt like we've seen variations of the movie already and it was easy to know everything to come. As stylistic as he may try to make it out to be, the only stylish thing is the black-and-white cinematography and all the movies and stage performances are shown in color. I don't think everything he did works (the first couple minutes of the movie did not start out so great), but he did make a solid movie in the end. Belfast is a heartfelt watch and has great performances and good writing, but I ended wanting more out of it. I do think this will go well with audiences and critics, some calling it the best of the year. It comes out in a couple weeks and is bound to win some Oscars, so check it out if you'd like.
good This film was funny, heartfelt, sad and scary all in one. Although it is based at the start of the troubles the film didn't fully focus on the terror those times caused. It was good to see the Northern Irish humour being portrayed. Belfast isn't just about bombs and religion.For those distraught about the film being black and white. Seriously?! I didn't even notice after about the 30seconds. It brought the film to its time and gave it charm. In all a great, mostly, light film based around a horrible time in Belfast.
ok A film that reminds you of the great moments in Lady Bird and JoJo Rabbit, with a coming of age arc at the center of a movie about what "home" means. But it doesn't quite live up to either story overall. Belfast is a well done film however, it also may be the years most overrated.7.2/10.
good Belfast is one of the best movies by Branagh.I completely fell in love with the script, its funny, its deep, turns a somewhat complex concept into a fair enough simple plot by the eyes of a child and what a performance by Jude Hill. He steals your whole attention since the beginning, authentic and emotional performance. Would it be too much to nominate him for an Oscar?Other thing I loved was the black-and-white vintage look. This kind of movies are rarely made now but usually are very good (like Roma, Cold War or more recently The French Dispatch) and this one doesnt run away from it.Overall I was glued to the screen from start to finish. If you havent seen it, what are you waiting for?
good Belfast is the equivalent of a stormy, rainy day, creating a perfect calm-before-the-storm kind of feeling. Written and directed by Kenneth Branagh, this family story is a tasteful, bittersweet masterpiece.Set in a small neighborhood in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s, Buddy (Jude Hill), a young boy from a small-town family, experiences life in tumultuous times. As religious tensions between the tight-knit community members grow, his family dodges shady neighbors and argues the question of moving out of Belfast while Buddy tries to ace his time tables. Belonging to the struggling working class, Buddy's father (Jamie Dornan) often travels for weeks at a time leaving him and his older brother (Lewis McAskie) to explore Belfast on their own. However, their father and mother (Caitriona Balfe) are always there to protect them when danger comes their way.Four things really stand out to me watching this film. First, the use of black and white with some color is really outstanding. It creates a sense of nostalgia and the few choice moments with color helps those scenes stand out. Second, the sound is absolutely fantastic. In every scene, there is a sound effect that enhances it, it's the sound of rain, fire, or a buzzing television. The quality of the sound effects is astounding, adding another layer of engagement when watching this film. Third, the acting is especially impressive. Young talent Jude Hilly, especially, is quite a star and steals the show. I also love the talent of Caitriona Balfe, who masters the strength and emotion of a mother. Lastly, every scene is very intimate; the camera is always up and close to the action and the family, making audiences feel closer to the main characters.Kenneth Branagh's film, based on a true story from his own childhood, touches audiences' hearts with an intimate view of family and the struggles of the working class. Parents should be aware there is some profanity, mention of religion, aggression and minor violence.I rate Belfast 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. This film opens in theaters November 12, 2021. By Abigail L., KIDS FIRST!
good 'Belfast', Kenneth Branagh's film, brings to the screen the story of one of those places which were and are too many on our planet. A place where families lived together for a long time sharing joys and challenges, where children grew up together, teenagers fell in love and adults greeted each other, chatted and helped each other even though the churches they prayed to or the languages they spoke at home were different. A place where the accumulation of nationalist or religious tensions fractured the social fabric and turned yesterday's neighbors into enemies. It happens today and we see the tragedies every night on the news. It happened for three decades in Northern Ireland during the period in history that is now called the 'Troubles'. 'Belfast' returns to 1969, the year of the outbreak of incidents, the deterioration of human relations and the first outbreaks of violence in Northern Ireland. For Kenneth Branagh, who is also the author of the screenplay, this is a film with obvious autobiographical overtones. Buddy, the hero of the film, is a nine-year-old boy, exactly the age of Branagh in the year his family decided to leave Belfast in flames and start a new life in England. 'Belfast' has not only the privilege of being told from the perspective of a child, but also the historical advantage of describing a conflict resolved through one of those agreements between enemies that seemed impossible during its peak times, an agreement that is maintained over two decades despite all the pessimistic predictions and historical upheavals. Can violence be attenuated or offset by nostalgia in such an account of a complex historical period? Kenneth Branagh largely manages to avoid the pitfalls and provide a positive response.The opening scene of 'Belfast' is very similar to the beginning of another film competing for this year's Academy Awards - Spielberg's 'West Side Story'. A street with simple people who seem happy with their lives. Neighbors know and greet each other cordially and a child plays freely the medieval knights using the lid of a trash can as a shield. However, the threat is at the edge of the street and violence is taking over the landscape, when a gang of Protestant extremists appears separating the Catholic 'enemies', terrorizing them, destroying their cars, shops, homes. The mother of the child who plays the knight saves him from violence and the play shield becomes the item to save their lives. The kid is Buddy and from his perspective the whole story is told. The family is not even Catholic, they are just moderate Protestants who do not divide the world into friends and enemies according to the way they pray to God. Sometimes this posture is more difficult. The father works in England, the mother raises the two boys practically alone, with heroism and dedication, but the violence around them increases, including the pressure to take a militant position in an absurd conflict, because otherwise ... The child attends his parents' discussions , is part of their dilemma to leave the city and neighborhood where they have lived all their lives, to go into exile in England or even further afield, in Canada or Australia. From his point of view, the parents are heroes, and that's how they look and behave, dedicated and doing their best to protect their children and raise them as good human beings. Much of the film transports us as in a time capsule into the lives of these 'ordinary' people trying to live decently in a troubled time, with all the meanings of the word 'decently'. The kids play and adults dance scenes, and especially those in the cinema are each anthology pieces.Kenneth Branagh proves in this very personal film that he can combine sensitivity and involvement with talent and perfect mastery of the secrets of the profession. In addition to the story itself, something or many interesting things are always happening on the screen. The cameras do pirouettes, follow the heroes, go down to the height of the boy who tells the story or rise above the roofs to put the action in context. Most of the film is black and white, with a Belfast filmed with love under the oppressive sky which seems permanently invaded by threatening clouds, but from time to time sequences or just spots of color mark feelings and moments of escapism. Like many of the directors who are also actors, Branagh manages to bring out the best of the talent of the actors he works with and makes them involve in the roles and blend into them. Caitriona Balfe creates one of the feminine roles that has impressed me the most lately. Jude Hill is great as thr storyteller. Seeing him, I wonder if anyone has ever thought of an Academy Award category for children's actors. Jude Hill would probably win the statuette this year. Judi Dench and CiarÃ¡n Hinds also create a memorable couple in the role of grandparents and the final frame with the actress will not be forgotten for a long time by those who saw the film. There are also a few moments of failure - a completely missed key scene, dialogues sometimes so rhetorical that sound like sermons for the obvious - but these only diminish to a small extent the strong impression that this film left on me. Describing a personal experience, dealing with a conflict that, at least for the moment, is extinguished, Kenneth Branagh alleviated the nightmare with the innocent perspective of a child growing up in the middle of a conflict zone and looking nostalgically at childhood, bringing back the shadows of his parents and grandparents. 'Belfast' is a film that, although set in a well-defined place and time, is painfully universal and actual.
good Kenneth Branagh's film offers a glimpse into his childhood in Belfast in the late 1960s when the city was being torn apart by sectarian violence. The narrative shifts from joy and wonder to fear and uncertainty with shocking smoothness.The story is told from the perspective of a young boy, who tries to make the most of his dodgy surroundings. His school, his strict Protestant church and his family all shape his identity. Meanwhile, his parents have a tenuous hold on their home and financial situation, primarily due to the father's long history of dodging tax obligations. The mother struggles to raise her boys in a safe and stable environment, especially as she mostly is left alone with the kids due to her husband working in England. The boy's grandparents are often his closest friends much of the time as their wisdom offers him comfort.This film covers it all, a realistic and honest reflection of the instability of Belfast's neighborhoods as well as the personal challenges of dealing with uncertainty and the dwelling question of leaving or staying in one's native environment. The conclusion is impeccable and left me choking up, a feeling that lingers on as I still ponder it. With an perfectly selected Van Morrison soundtrack, this one's a winner. Highly, highly recommended.
good This is the type of film that the Kashmiri Pandits of India deserve, about their exodus from Kashmir.It is autobiographical, with events pertaining to the Irish troubles of the late 60s, when there was large scale rioting between the Protestants and the Catholics, serving as the background. The foreground are growing up woes of Buddy, a "wee" boy, who lives with his mother and elder brother in Belfast, the epicenter of Troubles, with a father who works at far away England, a philosophical grand father and a witty grand mother. There are pleasant episodes about Buddy's schooling, his longing to be friends with the topper girl, marred by the always lurking violence.Brannagh- the director here, who is known more as an actor (seen most recently in No Time to Die as the chief villain), has also made some top notch films. This is surely his very best. The story, from the opening riot to the final act, is a scorcher and should get a nomination for the best original screenplay.This is touchy, just the right side of emotional without being too raw. It has thrills as well as drama and is easily one of the best films of 2021. Oscar nomination for best film looks like a certainty.
good As in don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge ... and so forth. There are problems we face in life and then there are real issues and uncertainty. If you live in certain areas or cities you have to face a lot of pain, heartache and have quite the strong will to survive. Now add an extended family and their (economic) struggle as well ... and you'll see the bigger picture.There are quite a few genuine moments here, there are other things in this that seem a bit too convinient too. Overall this is more than nicely told and mostly held in black and white (there are moments apart from the introduction where some light will shine through - pun intended).There is quirky moments too, either in the dialog (vegan satanists anyone), but also visually. The young boy who is terrific by the way, even in the one scene where you could accuse him of being annoying - his reaction is more than warranted in my book - his outburst and his passion to keep and hold on to the things he knows and has that is ... other than his performance Kenneth Branagh also gives him a comic book. Not any comic book, but a Thor one. Which goes to show that any rumours that you may have heard (I know I heard some), that he wasn't too pleased working with and for the MCU may not be based on anything.But while I talk about the light things (and the music is phenomenal in that respect too, with many recognizable songs, that probably were released up to the point the movie is supposed to play, also the original Star Trek and other things popping up as cultural references), there is a lot of drama and darkness here too. But it is that struggle and that juxtaposition between light and heavy, which is beautifully balanced that make this movie really worth your while.The universal themes will be touching anyone watching this. Music, references and so forth will add to that flavor for those in the know ... and the Academy has decided that that is enough to nominate the movie for quite a few Oscars ... good choice or not will depend on your taste, but the movie is more than well done and I am happy for those involved.
good This film is an absolute delight. It makes you smile from start to finish despite dark source material. It makes you feel and also makes you laugh. This film is quality from the cinematography, to the performances, to the script. It'll take a good film these next 11 months to displace this as my film of the year 2022.
bad January 2022 "Belfast" tells a story of a young boy who grows up in a turbulent time. Belfast it's all he knows, therefore he still loves Belfast and don't want to leave. It is a heartfelt story, and really connects with the viewers. The only scene in colour also gets you thinking as well.
good The word masterpiece is banded around too often when it comes to movies . Not by me .But this IS a masterpiece and it's film's like Belfast that are the reason I love this medium.This is Kenneth Branagh's semi autobiographical film about a young boy and his working-class Belfast family , who experience the tumultuous late 1960s through good and bad in Northern Ireland.There is so much I want to say about this film.Firstly , if it doesn't win best picture this year I will never watch The Oscars again . It's a marvel of a film without it being anything like a Marvel film , thank god.The cinematography is just amazing. It's predominantly set in black and white but there are little glimpses of colour that are just wonderful. One scene in particular where granny ( Judi Dench) is watching A Christmas Carol at the theatre with Buddy and the warm reflection of the colour from the stage is reflected in her glasses. Glorious.Despite it being set during the troubles in Belfast , this is not the topic of the film . It's about a family seen through the eyes of a child ( presumably Branagh?) and it's delightful. It's funny , it's heartbreaking , it's life and despite never setting foot in Belfast myself , It felt like I was Buddy .It's hard to pick out anyone in particular for their performances because everyone is amazing . From Jude Hill who plays Buddy to Judi Dench who plays Granny . The black and white makes all of her look her age and it's so beautiful. Even Jamie Dornan is great and I'm not usually convinced of his acting ability .To top this all off there is a fantastic soundtrack featuring mainly the brilliant Van Morrison .There are lots of references to films of the era .One scene that will stay with me for a very long time is when the family go to see Chitty Chitty bang bang and we see their reaction to the car going over the cliff and their body movements as if they are in the car themselves . GeniusKenneth Branagh has had a mixed past when it comes to directing films but he's made a movie here , that has blown me out of the water .As I said - A Genuine Masterpiece.
good Writer and director Kenneth Branagh really gets close and up front and intimate with his personal growing up awakening drama "Belfast". As the director claims it was of his past early life growing up in the late 60's in Northern Ireland. The film done in black and white captures the times and mood of the late 60's with the music and costumes, as we see young boy Buddy(Jude Hill) facing the trials and up and down times of family and life. However to make things complex even more the country and town both are going thru tense like uprisings of violence that involve religious and political differences. Still thru and thru Buddy's family remains tough and solid as stern Granny(the great Judi Dench) shines. And the biggest scene stealer is Caitriona Balfe as Buddy's tough loving overprotective mom who always does and wants the right thing for her family. Really this film is intimate a touching one of love and family a timely felt showcase that shows emotions and being tough outlast stormy and uncertain times. Director Kenneth Branagh has really scored here with a fine compelling personal epic family drama.
good Watched this tonight as part of sky vip premier showings (two days before general release in the uk).Found the film to be funny sad and catchy in all the right ways. Makes a change to watch something in black and white and I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it. But it has to go up there amongst one of the best films I have watched. The sound track is fantastic. I could
good Kenneth Branagh delivers a beautiful, heartfelt film about a family in 1969 Belfast. Branagh's love for the town of Belfast is palpable. The cast is superb--especially, Caitriona Balfe, whose portrayal as a wife and mother, torn between staying in her native Belfast as religious and political violence escalates or moving to England for her family's safety, is heartbreaking.
good Greetings from Lithuania."Belfast" (2021) is a wonderful movie written and directed by Kenneth Branagh. Clearly inspired on this person's childhood, this movie is not about religious disputes or anything like that. Its a movie about one men's memories about his childhood. What things look to him at the moment is what we see true his eye. And despite living on a different place and time me myself in my childhood i could easily relate to it because everyone remember their grandfather and grandmother for being ones heroes and etc. Their first best friends, their moms and dads and their inner backyard as being center of the world. At the end of this wonderful movie i remembered "Tokyo Story" (1953) because of its similar feeling and ideas it gave to me.Overall, perfectly paced at running time 1 h 35 min "Belfast" is one of the best movies i saw in some time. Directing and writing were probably best Kenneth Branagh has ever done. Acting was amazing by everyone and cinematography and art design really place one in that place and time. Great movie.
ok Director Kenneth Branagh returns to his childhood past in Belfast, a black and white memory of the age old struggle between Protestant and Catholic during heightened tension between the two in the late 60s and early 70s known as The Troubles. Branagh and clan left early in a conflict that would go beyond Northern Ireland borders and last 30 years so the title can be a touch deceptive in that it deals more with a family in conflict than present an all encompassing overview of a city and its people under duress that certain places (ex: Dunkirk) evoke.Belfast is mostly seen through the eyes of a child, impressively played by Jude Hill, as he tries to make sense of all the calamity as well as understand the logic of his parents and grandparents. As the parents in crisis Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan share some powerful scenes together while Ciaran Hinds turns in his standard solid work and Judy Dench delivers some touching moments as the grandparents.Branagh's direction is inconsistent though with some scenes flat and near pointless. His mise en scene rings artificial and some of his minor casting has a falseness to it as well. Branagh also shies away from expressing the deep seeded hatred between the two groups in favor of the family dynamic at play and in doing so dilutes the desperation they face. A mediocre nostalgia piece whose title and place in history deserves much deeper examination.
bad This movie was great from beginning to well 5 minutes before the ending. It's almost like they said "screw it let's just end it here to piss everyone off". I'm still waiting to find out "How it ends"
ok C'mon guys, where is the ending... we got 2/3rds of a movie.
ok At the beginning it was your average disaster/apocalypse film, something goes horribly wrong, government either can't handle it or won't, characters take problems into their own hands. All is well for a while, special effects are fine, acting is fine, but just like in the story, something goes terribly wrong. Much like that other Netflix film that was atrocious, the "horror" film about home invasion, it appears that the creators of the film either couldn't decide on an ending, or just threw their hands up and said "screw it, I don't know how to end it, lets just pretend to be ambiguous". And its not to say films with an ambiguous end aren't always bad, but this one didn't even bother to create an ending.As a Californian, we hold the stories dear, stories of earthquakes or other disasters ending civilized society. And for a while I was enjoying it, but somewhere around 2/3rds or half way through it, I just completely lost interest and was also disappointed in its execution. Without giving too much away, many decision made about how to execute certain parts of the film left me bamboozled, not the way I would have. All in all its good for a little while but ends up leaving you unfulfilled, so a warning, maybe just watch the first half, and don't worry, if you want to know what happens at the end, let me tell you, nothing.
ok Decent acting from both James and Whitaker. Suspenseful throughout, good effects but pretty standard "end of the world survivalist". Sure it ends in a weird place, it seems most reviewers are expecting it to turn into the walking dead or something. Its and unknown event causing nuclear winter and massive tectonic/volcanic disturbance, told from the view of the survivors. , nothing wrong with that. Likely survivors don't know WTF is happening, so just trying to survive as best they can.The biggest issue I had was:
ok May 2020 It seems like almost every Netflix movie is made with a sequel in mind these days, and this semi-apocalyptic drama is no different. Although the sudden breakdown of power and the subsequent abrupt - and frightening - collapse of law and order are fascinating to watch, How it Ends provides no reasons at all for what has taken place.
bad Really could have been an "above average" apocalypse film (I was ready to give the film a 7 until the final 5 minutes). Spoiler Alert - the film just ends abruptly and awkwardly, and credits roll. No one in production (who is not on heavy meds) could have thought that this was going to work.Compounding the ending issue is the film's final scene preceding the credits - oddly, the only truly dumb scene in the movie, wherein the protagonists somehow outrun a massive explosive cloud of deadly gas (moving at the rapid speed that such massive explosive clouds must travel) in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle along a winding mountain road. Uh huh...Did everyone just quit and walk off this production? Did the film exceed time and budget limits? Was production stopped by investors ("you have a half day left to complete the film's ending, and then we pull the plug people - Chop chop!!")One is left hanging and it is super awkward - It is not cool, nor witty, nor a neat play on words with the title. Something is not right as almost ANY other ending besides an abrupt cut-off would have saved this film.Even if one WERE to end it open-ended, there must be a half dozen more effective ways to do it for the big Twilight Zone moment.Nope! This movie just abruptly closes-up shop like a Paris post-office with patrons left in line... "It is 4:59PM - we are now closed - everyone leave - bonne soirÃ©e!Surely there is another final scene version somewhere in their digital files. If so, re-edit and re-release. If not, well the majority of reviewers got it right - ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž.
bad First of all, why does this clock in at 1:52? That's just too long for a standard thriller, and this is especially true for a movie with such a lousy story. There is nothing good in this movie. Nothing at all.Why would the convict in the cop car be so determined to track down one car?Just getting there takes WAY too much film time.Ricki Whatever was such a terrible character played by a worse actor.Has anyone involved in making this movie ever seen a movie before?
bad Utter trash. How anyone gave this piece of garbage more than 1 star (when will IMDB finally add a zero rating?) is beyond me. Incredibly stupid movie that barely kept my attention. What's the main problem you ask? I'm sick of apocalyptic films where we learn absolutely nothing about what's causing the disaster. Society falls apart in about four minutes, the government as usual is impotent. Yes these two men drive from the east coast to the west coast (one dying along the way) and barely break a sweat? One silly cliche after another and then - no pay off at all. Waste of time.
bad I mean really, the ending was so HILARIOUS. It was like they were in the middle of filming, then the director said "cut" and forgot to go back to work. I don't mind they're not telling us how and why this apocalypse happened, I really don't, sometimes it's good not to know all the details and just guess. But, man, they could have wrapped up the story somehow. Also, the storyline is quite repetitive, nothing extremely exciting happens, and in the last 20 minutes are a bit off. I'd say, avoid.
ok Seriously - this is how it ends? Seriously? This Netflix movie has the dumbest, most unfulfilling, most meaningless and even most infuriating ending I think I've ever come across in a movie. It's literally impossible to explain with any degree of satisfaction how it ends, because - well - it really doesn't end. It stops, but it doesn't end. Was the title supposed to be some sort of cute play on how it was actually going to end? Was there thought put into this? Was the non-existent end supposed to - in some way - be intelligent and thought-provoking? Or did absolutely everyone involved in putting this thing together just get collectively bored and say - "OK. What the hell. We're done. Time for a snack." It felt like the latter.What a letdown. I had actually been enjoying this movie. It was very effectively mysterious. You knew from the start that it was going to be. The opening caption was "Chicago: 5:33 am." Not 5:30 or 6:00, but specifically 5:33. I'm being a bit silly with that, but 5:33 tells you right off - something's happening. And something did happen. After a brief introduction relating a tense visit by Will to his in-laws in Chicago, we get right into it. Will is talking to his wife Sam in Seattle on the phone. And something happens there. There's a sound. She's obviously terrified. The line suddenly goes dead. It's quickly revealed that all contact with the west coast has been lost. Then power goes out - apparently everywhere. There's no communication, no satellites, no GPS. Nothing. The military appears. Panic builds, chaos ensues. And Will and his father in law Tom decide that they're going to have to drive to Seattle to find Sam. And in an increasingly panic-stricken and lawless nation that journey is going to be a challenge.I was really enjoying the story. And then something happened. I'm not sure what it was but I pin it pretty much to the point when Tom dies. Tom was played by Forest Whitaker. I've always liked Whitaker, although never really thought of him as someone who could carry a movie. But it all fell apart when his character died. I honestly didn't feel that any of the rest of the cast had truly stood out, but this had been mysterious and interesting and even at times exciting, but with the death of Tom it descended to just plain silly. And it kept getting worse. Right up to that ending that wasn't an ending. That ending that explained absolutely nothing. That ending that wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking but that honestly just seemed truly lazy on the part of everyone involved with this.Seriously - this is how it ends? I'm going to give this a 5/10, only because I had been enjoying this. But the last half hour or so gets about a minus 40.
ok Movies that are exclusive to Netflix wildly range in quality... though then again, so do movies from almost any other source. This particular one is one of the better ones I have seen for some time, though I will admit that it does have some major flaws that hold it back from being better than it ultimately is. I could live with the fact that the reasons for the apocalypse in the movie - and its extent - are not fully spelled out. However, the screenplay does seem in a way to be making up things as it goes along, and that it doesn't have much of a plot - the movie is basically one vignette after another. Also I do agree with many of the other IMDb comments that the ending of the movie is quite unsatisfying and abrupt. Still, flaws and all, I was never bored by the movie. Though the movie is just a collection of vignettes, the vignettes for the most part do come across fairly realistically; you will feel that law and order has broken down in a believable manner. The production values are sound, and the performances are fine as well. I am certainly not saying that this is a GREAT movie, but I do think it's somewhat better than most people here are saying. It's best watched during a slow night.
ok It's the end of the world as we know it! Or is it? We don't know, this movie can't be bothered to tell us. After some kind of unexplained catastrophic event happens on on the west coast of the US, Will (Theo James) and his girlfriend's obnoxious father (Forest Whitaker) commence a road trip from Chicago to Seattle to save her (Kat Graham). It appears that the disaster has also ended electricity supplies across the entire country. Most of the people they do meet are gun-toting hillbilliess or (maybe) escaped prisoners all intent on killing them and stealing their car. Most of the trip seems to happen in the dark with loud ambient music covering up the limited dialog. When the sun does rise we are treated to a highlight reel of some of the US's most beautiful landscapes, suddenly devoid of people. I wonder who is lighting all the roadside fires they keep driving past. In summary. The film is mostly too dark to see anything, the characters learn nothing and show a deplorable lack of curiosity about the world, and then the film just stops. Dull.
bad How it ends... Good title for a movie that had no ending. I guess the writers had no idea what was happening in this world either, since they couldn't be bothered to tell us. This movie had so much potential that was never realized. Time after time they set up a premise that never pays off. Going into this I was very excited, but wondered if I would be left disappointed. In the end I have to say I am very disappointed. No explanations, and the end of the movie was as if the writers just gave up. Unless this is being set up for a sequel or a series which I seriously doubt. This movie is an epic failure.
ok This film had potential and if you're looking to kill time, it's quite alright - a good amount of suspense throughout the film. But like basically every other review here, the film it cuts to the credits without really explaining anything.
bad Incredibly amateur drivel that's half filmed in almost total darkness. Some decent actors are wasted by writers who've clearly wrote the characters in 10 minutes flat for a paycheck.Tough ex-marine father in law? (Who is really a big softie of course) Check.
ok Huge potential, but failed.Whitaker was great, as always, although he didn't get much to work with. The actor playing 'Ricki' was close to horrible.It was so frustrating to get no answers, or explanations, to what was going on. The characters also didn't seem to care about discussing it, or trying to find out what was going on.There were also several plotholes; Why would the bad guy in the cop car go through so much trouble to chase down one random car?
ok Good movie but the ending made it feel like a pilot, they just stopped filming & went for lunch?
bad Man loses girl. Man looks for girl, then.......actually I can't be bothered. I would finish this review but I'm doing what the movie did. Stop abruptly with no ending.
ok I can only think a second is in the pipeline, as that can be the only reason for such a rushed ending. Ambiguity in films is fine, I would praise the film for leaving certain parts to the viewers imagination, sometimes it's got that every strange occurrence in a film isn't black and white, ambiguity fine, lack of ending terrible.Previously to the bad ending, the film isn't at all bad, it's well acted, with some very well developed characters. You get to see human nature at its best, worst, plus you see what people will do when pushed to desperation.Some fantastic special effects, it looks and sounds brilliant, I can't fault that side of the film at all. The lazy ending kills the film for me though, did they run out of ideas or money, or is a second on the way.Decent, but lame ending. 6/10
bad I haven't been more frustrated with a film in a long time.
ok HOW IT ENDS is, unfortunately, another unwieldy Netflix film that doesn't work all that well. The story once again features the apocalypse (and some pretty nifty CGI effects, especially at the climax) and involves a couple of main characters attempting to escape from it with their lives. Sadly, HOW IT ENDS is generally mired in familiarity and tedium. The events that play out have been done countless times in the movies and they're done no differently here. The script is lowbrow, relying too heavily on profanity throughout with little wit or character insight; as such, genuinely good actors like Forest Whitaker are wasted in their roles. The end result is a mildly watchable but distinctly average kind of movie that you'll forget about soon after watching.
bad Shows great promise at the beginning then takes a long, winding, pointless journey across the country and drags the viewer over every po-dunk, shotgun toting hillbilly infested, gravel road this country has to offer to a miserable, unanswered and totally dissatisfying end. I want my 1 hour and 52 minutes of my life back that I wasted on this disaster and a disaster movie.
ok For a film named how it ends, it unfortunately is missing an ending
bad Just created an account to say this is THE WORST ENDING EVER !!!
ok Really loved the story, effects, characters and then suddenly...... end.
good The last three movies I saw in theater were real dogs. I won't say what they were, but the last one rhymes with "fake tricks." I was in a movie slump, which made me a little apprehensive about "Sing 2." Turns out there was no need to be apprehensive at all, this movie was amazing."Sing 2" had all the old gang minus the mouse. The movie began with a Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) production with a big time talent scout from Redshore City in the audience. Redshore City is like a suped up Las Vegas. Moon's updated musical version of "Alice in Wonderland" wasn't enough to impress the scout, but Moon would not be denied. In his classic hustling fashion he got his theater troupe on the Redshore City stage to secure a full musical, but with one big condition: he'd need Clay Calloway (Bono) in his production. With a new act, a new member, a missing link, and his life on the line, Moon would need a miracle to make it all happen.I don't know why, but I liked "Sing 2" even more than "Sing." The musical numbers, again, were fantastic and the plot was wonderful. All of the characters are easy to like and the music works with the flow of the movie as well as the feel of the movie. Even though the plot is very similar to part one, enough elements were different to make it fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.
good Sing 2 (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows the gang from the first film performing together in the same theatre and not making it big time as they hoped. They decide to pack up and head to Vegas for an audition for a show on the strip. They win the audition but in doing so promised a star for the show who has long since retired. As the gang gets ready for their big act they will need to try and convince a star who has been out of the industry for 15 years to return to performing.This movie is directed by Garth Jennings (Sing) and contains the voices of Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Scarlett Johansson (Avengers), Tara Strong (Power Puff Girls), Jason Schwartzman (Moonrise Kingdom) and Nick Kroll (Sausage Party).The movie starts with a bang with a fantastic rendition of Alice and Wonderland and is brilliant from there. The audition sequence in this is hilarious. The ending show is very well done and fun to watch unfold. They did a great job of not tipping off the final performance to the audience. The song selection is awesome and the portrayal of the characters is excellent. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The storyline unfolds well but predictably and the villain is perfectly intense.Overall this is a very well done movie that is a perfect follow-up to the first movie with a well thought-out plot and good use of characters. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.
ok First, I thought Sing (2016) was funny and entertaining. It had great voice acting, great characters, good songs, great musical numbers, and pretty animation.So, I wasn't expecting much in the sequel. But, after watching I found it was just as good as the first movie.Sing 2 (2021) was really entertaining. The characters are voiced well by the same great voice cast and I thought they were also funny.There were scenes I didn't expect, and they were funny especially when there are serious moments, then they are surprising.The songs are good, and the voice actors can sing well, along with great choreographed dance numbers. The animation is pretty and has improved since the first movie.I think Illumination animation is really good and they've done great movies, like Despicable Me. The 3rd act was surprising and the final performance is nicely staged with great songs.When the 3rd act starts, I start liking the movie even more while it keeps surprising me with unexpected scenes. I really do suggest watching Sing 2 (2021), but only if you liked the first one.I really think you will laugh and will be really entertained in how it plays out.
good If you haven't seen Sing (the first movie), I recommend seeing it before you watch this one. There is a lot of carry over jokes and information you need to see first.Other than this, you should just enjoy the movie. The entire family did and the kids were laughing. There are plenty of singing, dancing, and hit songs. The script is easy to follow, the characters are funny and the movie isn't slogged down with any politics, sex or drugs. It's just fun entertainment, the way a movie should be made.
ok Suited for young and old. Endearing musical movie about funny cartoon characters voiced over by famous actors and singers.For me especially the U2 songs were interesting to listen to and Bono's voice over was pretty funny as well. For U2 fans especially it is worth while taking a peek at this movie for the new U2 covers, which are quite fun to listen to. And let's not forget this is Bono's acting debut, although in the costume of an old, but gracious lion...
ok I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sing 2 was better than the original. Although I didn't have an extremely high opinion of the first film, this sequel took the same elements and really blew me away. All the characters are true to their personalities and develop more as they confront challenges on a larger scale than ever before. Tired of being overlooked, the ever ambitious Buster Moon cheats his way into the dazzling Redford City and wins over Crystal and his daughter... for as long as he can! The rest of the cast find they're not what it takes, as Suki had warned them, but they force themselves to make the show work, no matter what. Throughout this film we get many new characters and some returning ones, which does mess up the flow of the film and makes the plot feel choppy at times, but it all comes together at the end.
ok Unbelievably great. Although Sing film series has only one purpose that they perform a great show no matter how difficult situation they are in, I didn't think that it would turn out to be this great. That being said, I'd like to see some other different plots. Still, it's so much fun and in my opinion, it's better than the first one. I had a great time with this film.
ok Sing 2 continues with the story of Buster Moon(Matthew McConaughey) & his buddies. They try to persuade the notoriously private rock music icon, Clay Calloway(Bono), to sing with them for a new musical, they're staging.Sing 2 is a fun film. Director Garth Jennings has retained the feel-good spirit of Sing(2016) & of course lots of new foot-tapping songs sung by our favorite stars. The original music by U2 lead singer Bono, is fantastic. The cast's voice-overs & their singing, is the highlight of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as Buster Moon. Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as Rosita. Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as Ash. Tori Kelly is outstanding as Meena. Taron Egerton is phenomenal as Johnny. Bobby Cannavale is perfect as Mr. Crystal. Bono is excellent as Clay Calloway. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Sing 2 is a must watch, with your entire family. Go & singalong with your favorite characters.
good It's not often that a sequel is actually better than the original, but I can certainly say that that was the case here, Sing 2 came out of nowhere and was an incredible surprise.You might not know this, but Matthew McConaughey is one of my absolute favorite actors ever, and he's one of the the reason I love these films so much, he carries all of them.The first sing was awesome, and Interstellar was gorgeous, he was perfect in Interstellar and smashed it here.Johnny and Meena get much better character work than the previous film, and I was so happy when his dad appeared.Sing 2 also features some of my favorite songs ever, they need to release a sing-along version.This animation is spectacular, just like the first one, that ending sequence is breathtaking, and Sing 2 is extremely funny.Whoever got rock star Bono here deserves an award or something, perfect casting choice, he plays a very damaged character, and when he started performing it was amazing.Sing 2 is a better, funnier, realer version of the first one.A+.Perfect way to end the year.
good The sequel to the 2016 original is more of the traditional 'Little Rascals/let's put on a show' as our intrepid promoter, voiced by Matthew McConaughey's Buster Moon, has hopes of taking his mildly successful local show to the big leagues; a Las Vegas like residency but after the scout is not overly impressed by their little show, Moon decides to gather the troops anyway to hopefully crash an audition. Getting his foot in the door, Moon bluffs his way to the show's backer, voiced by Bobby Cannavale, he can produce a reclusive singer, voiced by Bono, out of hiding to participate in their new production; a sci-fi travelogue created by Gunther, Nick Kroll but there is one caveat, Cannavale wants his daughter, singer Halsey, in the show so off the movie goes as the various cast members have their tasks to do interspersed w/warbling of recent hits keeping the well rendered visuals a delight & even though it's not to the story caliber of say Pixar films, they nonetheless still entertain a whole bunch.
good Buster Moon's proteges are playing sell-out shows in Buster's theatre, but he has bigger ambitions. He wants success for them in Redstone City, the centre of shiwbiz despite being refused an audition, he manages to blag his way into a big budget show for them, but paints himself into several corners in the process, not least of which is extreme danger from Mr Crystal, who commissioned the show. So, while production is under way, moves are afoot to find Clay Calloway, the star Buster has promised. The only thing is that no-one has seen Calloway for 15 years...My first reaction was that I've forgotten the characters and why I should care about them. But the opening number was such a firecracker that I was immediately caught up in the main story and its various subplots, and remained so until the end. So I simply offer several thoughts (among many):1. The musical sequences are terrific;
good This movie is wonderful, gorgeous, sad, sweet, and entertaining. You can't help but shed a few tears and bob your head with the beat. It's a feel-good experience without much substance but a ton of joy! Please go see it and feel again :)
good I had one more look at my review of the previous installment - I could almost copy paste it here - it's once again riddled with clichÃ© - in fact I could say its basic premise is one of the biggest clichÃ© in the book - follow your dream - is basically the heart of the so called "American dream" - if you really try hard you'll make it - just - never give up.So - no originality and no surprises at least not in the basic plot. But here's the thing - when you have such wonderfully written roles performed so beautifully by the still stellar cast - it doesn't really matter. And the fact that the basic plot isn't very original is all but forgotten when the narrative twists and turns following these lovely characters we're all so fond of by now. It may not be surprising it's still riveting because we care. We want to see these characters as they struggle on their way to fulfill their dream. We want to see them make it big.As it's so character driven one must mention the voice acting. As a rule they're all great, but I've got to make some special notes for Bobby Cannavale who's brilliant as the villain and for Halsey who does very well as his spoilt daughter. The entire original cast is still shining bright and one more special mention must go to Bono who does surprise performing the role of the aging recluse Clay Calloway.Bottom line - it's well done, it's charming, fun and funny all other details are beside the point.
ok 7/10 - while I do not think Sing 2 does anything to reinvent any wheels nor may it be the most memorable release, I had a lot of fun watching this music-filled, visually-stunning, and all-around fun flick that ranks as my favorite animated film of the year.
good I found this sequel much more fun than the first film. It had me tapping and humming along. The story was well put together too. Excellent character development. This is certainly one of my top ten animated musicals. The animation quality was pretty good too. This is really a film the whole family can enjoy, both young and older will have grins and smiles on their faces by the time the end credits roll. A very good, feel-good film.
good Sentimental and ridiculous. Loved every minute of it. Great voice cast and choice of songs. Can't stand Bono or U2 but all is forgiven now. Think I might watch it again....
good This was such a cute movie, watched it in theaters today with my family and we all loved it. I think its way better than the first! Usually they have a tendency to mess up sequels and they didnt with this one. I cried twice at the end it was so sweet Mr. Moon finally made nana proud.
good LIKES:The Animation:
good This movie is really enjoying, fun, and spectacular. The musical show was amazing and I really love it and I love all the soundtracks too, and i really like the stage and the stage theme it look so good. Idk why y'all hating on Meena I mean she's not that annoying in this sequel but Porsha oh god she's very annoying girl, like she thought she's the main character and can blame everyone, and I think that one cat is a gay cause he look so fruity with Porsha dad, I was kinda shock when miss crawly eyes was fall. The ending show was super boom super amazing, I really amaze when clay come to the stage and start play his guitar and sing, and the set on the ending was super cool, I was like WOW that was so amazing. The animation, Visual, Song, sound it was so good, the animation was really detail look like Pixar animation without Disney Style, and the animation was really detail to. I really enjoy the movie but the question is what Suki tell the police man to get that wolf (Porsha dad)
ok Sing 2 is the sequel to the 2016 film of the same name and features the voice talents of Matthew McConaghey, Reese Witherspoon, Taron Egerton,Tori Kelly and Scarlett Johanson with new additions from Bobby Cannavale,Leitha Wright, Halsey,Pharell Williams and Bono(the lead singer from the Irish band U2).Buster Moon(McConaghey) is back with his gang and this time he wants to set up a new show with Cal Calloway(Bono) to star. But when Buster and Ash(Johanson) track Cal down they discover that he is now a recluse and doesn't want to sing nor play anymore. Will Buster persuade Cal to star in the new show?.Overall I enjoyed this film as its got great songs from current acts like Camila Cabello,Shawn Mendes,Ariana Grande,Coldplay and U2. If you loved the 1st film then you will enjoy this feelgood film. Bono surprised me in this film as it was his first acting gig as well as his animated debut
good "Sing 2" is a charming and enjoyable follow up to the 2016 "Sing" and in many ways is the rare sequel that surpasses the original. The new film finds Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) and his performers enjoying a run of sod out shows in his theater.Unwilling to settle for success in a regional locale; Buster and crew set off for the big city to produce and perform a show for Bigshot Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale); who is as ruthless as they come. After conning his way into an audition; Buster claims their new show will feature the return of reclusive Rock Icon Clay Calloway (Bono); who has been a recluse for the past fifteen years.Jimmy is intrigued and gives Buster a chance and inserts his daughter Porsha (Halsey) into the show despite the fact that while she is a gifted singer; her acting is cringe worthy.What follows is a madcap tale filled with music and humor as the crew desperately try to get the show ready and stay away from the very dangerous Jimmy Crystal.The music is very good and the cast is as enjoyable as ever. I would have liked to have seen Seth Mac Farlane return but the performances from Taron Egerton, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, and the ensemble more than deliver.For those who enjoyed the first film and are looking for some fun entertainment for the family; "Sing 2" is a winning performance.4 stars out of 5.
good Buster Moon has a dream: to be the most successful koala in showbiz. In "Sing," he managed to salvage the run-down venue where his musical theater ambitions might thrive, much to the delight of family audiences. Now, in that toon's jam-packed "let's put on a show" sequel, Buster Moon and his menagerie of pigs, primates and other crooning critters head to Redshore City - the Las Vegas-like entertainment capital of their parallel universe, which is basically human in every way except for the fact that there are no humans to be found in it - to launch a massive song-and-dance extravaganza. If "Sing 2" sounds like a shameless excuse for a bunch of celebrities to perform cover versions of Top 40 hits while animated animals lip-sync the lyrics for our amusement ... well, that's essentially what it is. Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) and friends set out to pitch an original show to oddly Trump-like hotelier Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale), a white wolf with an enormous arena to fill and nothing to draw in the crowds, joined by U2 megastar Bono as a rocker they must lure from retirement for the big night. Bono is an undeniably big get for Illumination, although one assumes that Universal just backed up the cash truck, getting a new U2 tune in the process. The "Sing" recipe is all about recycling familiar songs, but that track, "Your Song Saved My Life" - which is terrific - hints at how special this franchise could be if the team committed to writing original music instead. It's a more unified sequence than the series of solo performances that concluded Sing, emphasizing the camaraderie of a company that's not just a collection of performers anymore, but a community with its own set of values and aspirations. Sing 2 gave me goosebumps when Bono stated walking out playing his famous song, Your Song Saved My life... truggling with loss, Calloway just can't find any reason to sing again after the passing of his singular inspiration. By adapting the melodies of some of the grieving lion's own songs and internalizing their emotional arcs,. Sing 2 will hit theaters December 22, 2021. #sing2.
good That maybe better then the 1st. Watched this movie tonight and it was hilarious. Illumination made another hit! The music to the story it was a good movie. Adults and kids could enjoy.
good At first i though the animation was quite 'off' the track, but it just the Sing style. As soon as the movie going i can finally see the great detail again. So sorry for my inpatient.The story is good, delivery with so much fun, and a good fast phase. Waste no time.The movie fill with some serious emotion from the half of the time its been going, clay calloway present really add some spark to this movie. Have so much goosebumps moment me personally.
ok Before writing a review I always ask myself two questions. Was I entertained for the entire movie? Was it well made? I have to answer yes on those two questions for The Night House. The story is slow paced but it has a constant intriguing plot that keeps you wondering what is happening. It's not one of those movies you figure out everything from the beginning. There aren't really scary moments, not even jump scares but there's some good suspense and mystery. The acting wasn't bad at all so nothing bad to write about that either. In this genre The Night House is definitely worth a watch.
ok Well-made psychological horror flick with a great performance by Rebecca Hall. It can be considered a slow burn but I was fully invested and never bored. Very atmospheric. Lots of beautiful shots. Some effective scares. Great movie overall and I would definitely watch it again. (1 viewing, 2/7/2022)
good THE NIGHT HOUSE (2021) *** Rebecca Hall, Sarah Goldberg, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Evan Jonigkeit, Stacy Martin. Compelling supernatural drama about a recently widowed woman (Hall in a remarkable performance) who begins to question her sanity when she begins to make discoveries of her late husband's past as well as their home which seems to house a sinister presence. Well directed by David Bruckner with just the amount of dread and genuine jolts thanks also to a shrewd screenplay by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowsk. The pin-pricking score by Ben Lovett & handsomely shot cinematography by Elisha Christian makes all the difference in this modern day ghost story.
good If you like supernatural / psychological thrillers with give it a try. Nice Elements of the movie:>Creepy, nice, dark atmosphere.>Solid performances.>Beautiful cinematography.>Camera optical illusions (set up carefully in order to define "nothing-ness").Spoilers follow! A complete explanation guide:Beth dies for 4 minutes when she was 17 and she sees nothing in the other side. That "nothing-ness" (that she experienced) was expecting to get her life.Think of that "nothing-ness" as the Spirit of Death (SoD from now on) or the Death or something similar (SoD: "I am what you felt when your heart stopped").But SoD was tricked by Beth since she managed to recover. Now, it wants to reclaim her life back and comes after her (SoD's Main Objective). But since Beth is NOT the believer-type, SoD cannot interact directly with her.Quite soon Beth marries Owen (Heather: "You were married young!") Owen is a believer-type, so SoD establishes a channel with Owen in order to get Beth's life.Owen starts to sleepwalk (Beth: "A year or two after building our house...") and having weird dreams in which SoD demands from him to end Beth's life.Owen tries through occult arts to protect Beth. Reading "Caerdroia" he discovers in chapter "Decoys and Deception" a way to trick SoD ("People have sought remedies to threats posed by evil...")Such trick can be done via "Voodoo dolls at gravesites near to those afflicted... activated by contact with the intended recipient... mazes and reversed spaces to confuse dark forces".So Owen starts his plan "... by distorting the identity (i.e. Other women looking like Beth) and location (i.e. Other house like Beth's house) of the subject, pursuing spirits could be tricked by false forms of sacrifice."His plan is to trick SoD by sacrificing a woman looking like Beth in a reversed place looking like his house, as he read in "Caerdroia".Owen builts secretly that house like the one he and Beth lives, but in a reversed architecture (blueprints are discovered by Beth).He makes the voodoo doll, puts the related spell and puts it in the secret house. Then he meets women looking like Beth and he brings them to the secret house. He makes them touch the voodoo doll (i.e. Activates the channel between SoD and the woman) and he chokes them as offering to SoD.SoD is tricked but when it finds out it did not get Beth's life, it presses again Owen. Owen meets another woman like Beth, and that loop goes on for 6 times (Beth: "... half a dozen"). Thus SoD is tricked for a while (Beth: "He tricked you!", SoD: "For a while... he thought he could protect you").At the end Owen having guilts does not kill Madelyne, the girl in the bookstore (Madelyne: "he was shaking and crying") who has been left with tender feelings and has not understood anything evil.Aware that SoD cannot hurt directly Beth, Owen kills himself and leaves behind the known note. "You are right. There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You are safe now."Note means: There is really that "nothing-ness" that you experienced when you died (i.e. The SoD) and it is after you. But now you are safe because I die, so there will be no channel existing between SoD and you (it's like saying "there is no way for you to be hurt onwards").But unfortunately that channel is established since Beth discovers and touches the voodoo doll, although she remains a non-believer-type (you can see that during the conversation she has with Madelyne in Beth's house).SoD now can interact with her physically (touch her) and has all the potential needed to make her kill herself.Beth tricks SoD once again in the boat and does not kill herself. But SoD is there and we know as the movie ends that SoD will do anything till it gets Beth's life._____
ok It has the trappings of genre films I like, and how it peels back layers of information is very compelling. That said, I found the ending anti-climactic, and I wanted it to leave me feeling more unnerved than it did.
good Greetings from Lithuania."The Night House" (2020) was a very solid story solidly told. I liked the overall idea - it kinda reminded of some past movies (no spoilers), but it still was fresh and intriguing. Execution was also very solid - at running time 1 h 45 min this movie never dragged and i was caught in this mysterious spooky story from beginning till the very end. Also this just might be Rebecca Hall's one of the very best performances ever - she carries the whole story.Overall, "The Night House" isn't a horror fest, but it was spooky and overall mood was pretty haunting. When everything was revealed i did appreciate the story - it was intriguing, kinda fresh and very well told. Very solid movie.
good Positives:
ok First there is Hall who, until now, has been punching below her weight class and finally gets to show she can carry a film. A tight script, nicely directed. And some genuinely scary scenes.
good Grief, or any other stages off mental imbalance , then take a big breath and consider if youre strong enough at all to devour the frights of loss that unfold in this psychologicalsy drama called the night house. Its a dark , sad and strong story about being victimized due to suicide.The acting done by rebecca hall is pretty significant, and reading through my register of actresses that ive n in my mind , i cant find anyone that can replace her on the deeds of acting the wway she does. Do also consider that ms hall aint one of my favs, and that should be an insignia of quality if you ask me...its a story about grief after a suicide of close realations, a husband, that had no signs whatsoever to do so., the plot shows us the estranged wife searching for clue and symptoms on why. Its told in a vast amount of flashbacks, and utterly vivid nightmares that becomes so realistic at moments, and so scary to encounter, that my life as a fly on the wall got the eyes wide shut, prefering to watcth the corner of the screen jusst to avoid the scary moments that are to unfold.The dream sequences and the knots and tackles to make the strings of thread into a solid rope of a story are just ammazing, the score helps a lot, and the play of light , shadow andd reflection is superb. Its like a near death experience in your dreams, and deep long wandering in paralell universes and shadowlands that may exciste or not. A parapsychologist couldve made a 6 hour documentary just analysing the para-lelles that occuurs in this thrillerdrama.Aamazing it is, and many thoughts struck my ever so cronical depressive state of mind whiile viewing like the subject of afterlife, ghosts, parallel universe and mirror worlds. Therefore i recommend this flick pointing back to the start of this review, it might be heavy for some. The grumpy old man though might take a float in the boat without any oars whatsoever.
ok Good pace, Brilliantly acted, and above all intense and genuinely creepy......But,And this is where it looses me...Being Vague isn't intelligent.So many films these days just skip over that little part where it all comes together. Where the plot thickens. They avoid massive plot holes And just look the other way.There are whole scenes in this movie that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, they are only there to be scary and mysterious, but don't further the plot or are even explained in anyway.It's A Mystery if the Writer clearly has no idea how to end it?Would "Seven" have been a better film if we never found out "Whats in The Box"?AnticlimacticLeaving the viewer to fill in the voids is lazy storytelling.Rant over.
good I'm blown by this horror story, I regret reading anything bad because it's way wrong! Rebecca Hall's character deals with the aftermath of her husband's suicide and is haunted with mysteries throughout. David Bruckner directed a crafty well done version of what tremendous loss is like. I absolutely loved the presence of unknown entity whenever it happens especially the epilogue is so good! I don't mean to spoil anything but I chose yes just in case. It's a shame The Night House isn't making more money cause it definitely deserves it.
ok They took so long getting to the reveal that the ending feels completely rushed and does not provide crucial information that would have given more context to what was going on. (The "bathroom scene") did not play with the rest of the movie and was so outlandish that it completely pulled me out of the movie. She is being thrown against a wall with a mirror, so he must have some power, but still doesn't kill her, The same gun that was used by her husband and was returned (presumably loaded?) by the police?!! The audience leaves confused about what happened, why it happened, or even how it happened. "Nothing" suspended Beth in the position like the statue she found? But he couldn't kill her?? I couldn't understand why after she found the dead bodies she went back home and took a shower and still wanting to see her husband after she found out he murder a lot of women. This movie make no sense.
ok For the first hour of the movie I was very much intrigued by this slowly but effectively unfolding story, getting more and more bewildered, just like main character Beth, by the weird and scary goings-on. The photography is great, and beside a nice sinister atmosphere, there are multiple jump-scares to keep you on the edge of your chair. Rebecca Hall carries the whole movie admirably, she's totally convincing, first as the grieved and forlorn widow of a husband that out of the blue committed suicide, subsequently as the exasperated woman who thinks she's losing her mind. She's not trying to win our sympathy with her aggrieved and angry behavior and her heavy drinking, but you do team up with her when her world turns upside down on her.Unfortunately in the last half hour, when you expect that all loose ends finally will come together, the story went totally overboard, every other new thing that Beth finds out about her husband only made the narrative get more and more incomprehensible, and at last the weirdness and confusion escalated into a conclusion that was really too mind-boggling, at least for my simple brain.But maybe expecting some logic in a supernatural ghost story is a bit naive anyway.
bad U dont come to watch a horror or a thriller movie for the lead actor's performance.The movie basically starts off like What lies Beneath but with a lousy climax, it is also lifted from various other psychological movies where they take solid amount of time, show the lead actress at peril throughout while nothing happens to her and then they end with a so called happy ending.There is a scene where the lead actress discovers lots of dead bodies but rather than calling 911 or trying to flee, the lead actress calls her best friend n later head for the shower.
ok ... Frightening, Unnerving, Nightmares! The widow of a shock suicide is haunted by dreams and reality from the past, and the present. A towering performance by Rebecca Hall makes all the difference in a story that will leave you scratching your head and your chin but for all the right reasons.
good After an extremely poorly timed lock-down in my country days before 'The Night House' - one of my most anticipated films of the year - was due to come out, I finally got the chance to see it yesterday. Getting overly excited for an upcoming film is rarely a good omen. I find that films like 'Midsommar', where the reality actually lives up to the hype, are rare. 'The Night House' was still an excellent film, but it wasn't quite the masterpiece I had been hoping for.Rebecca Hall is very good in this film. She has a very complex and demanding role and she nails almost every scene. She is basically asked to carry the entire film on her own too. None of the other roles are overly significant and are more just there to guide her journey along.There are some decent scares in this film including one that got my heart racing. The film isn't a conventional horror in any sense. It isn't looking to make you jump every chance it gets. But when it does have one of those scenes it does it very well.It plays into the story somewhat, but there are some misleading dream sequences that I thought were a little cheap and a film this classy didn't need them. It's a small bugbear though. I had a very good time with 'The Night House' and even if it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped I'd still highly recommend it.
good October 2021 With a dreadful, disquieting atmosphere pervading its frames and a dark, disturbing mystery simmering beneath the surface, The Night House makes for a gripping, haunting & gradually escalating psychological horror with a plot that only gets more uneasy & uncomfortable as it progresses, and is powerfully anchored by Rebecca Hall's emotionally engrossing showcase.Directed by David Bruckner (The Ritual), the story explores loss, grief, depression, loneliness, death & longing through vehicles of horror and is able to keep us invested in the proceedings throughout its runtime with surprising ease. Bruckner fills the space with an unnerving chill & sense of dread and unravels the mystery one step at a time but the ending isn't as satisfying as expected.The isolated setting, silent camerawork, steady pace & smart editing help ratchet the tension when required while the poignant score keeps reminding us of the crushing weight of the void that's opened up in our protagonist's life in the wake of her husband's demise. And rendering her loss & depression with unfailing precision is Rebecca Hall in what's undoubtedly amongst her career-best performances.Overall, The Night House is an intelligently crafted, skilfully told, effectively shot & brilliantly acted genre offering that quietly immerses the viewers into its unsettling premise and has a firm grip on our emotions before we even know it. Exhibiting first-rate work on all fronts and further bolstered by Hall's committed act, this atmospheric horror does falter in the last act but everything before it is intense & riveting. Don't miss it.
ok Said "CALL THE POLICE" about 15 times during this film.Finding the bodies of lord known how many people in the unfinished house Owen was secretly building (how did he get away with that?) was one major police moment. Frankly I kept waiting for her to report this but she never did! Protecting hubby or writer laziness?I dislike open endings. I think it is the epitome of sloth for the writer and or the director to leave the audience in a state of wtf. Considering so much of this film took place in a "dream state", a dose of clarity was required.
ok This movie got under my skin. I am sure that a lot of people who watch it will have some major issues with how some things are handled. I wasn't 100% happy with all the choices the filmmakers made. It feels like some of the reveals could have had more of an impact if they were handled differently. However, I felt that overall, it was very effective at building and maintaining suspense. It is rare to find a scary movie that actually makes you feel something, but this one kept me anxious much of the time. I liked the lead performance, also. Even though I thought the main character did some unlikeable things, I appreciated that she didn't react to everything with typical horror movie stupidity. So for me, this film stands out. I don't know that it is one I will enjoy watching back, but as a first viewing, I enjoyed the experience.
ok The Night House may not be perfect, but it takes some chances and has a nice puzzle at its heart that makes sense the further you go into the movie. It fits nearly into that sub-genre of a genre, the giallo where a woman is either gaslighting herself, being gaslit or going slowly insane (for more, see Footprints on the Moon, The Perfume of the Lady in Black, The Psychic and Lizard In a Woman's Skin).It also would work well within the seventies style of film - Let's Scare Jessica to Death is a high mark, but it shoots for it - where things happen slowly and then the end races you through the conclusion. Once the puzzle box is opened, things get wild in a hurry.I first took notice of Rebecca Hall in Christine, a movie I didn't like but loved her in it. She anchors this movie and makes it work, often through the sheer determination of her commitment to the activities around her. Sure, she's dealing with the suicide death of her husband, but she's also pushing against the ridiculousness of it all, such as students pushing for better grades and fellow teachers wanting to know details but too ashamed to ask. Some of it becomes humor to her. And yet, so much more of it is horror, as a mirror house seems to exist in the woods by her home.Her husband's phone keeps texting and calling her. Music randomly blares. Dreams are filled with his image and voice. And when she finds his phone, she finds pictures of women who are not her, but look exactly like she does.The sound design is incredible. The editing is perfect. The effects and the way they work hand-in-hand with the cinematography is what others films should aspire to. And the plotting and the maze it leads you down can be forgiven when it loses its way sometimes, because unlike the glut of Blumhouse dreck, this movie will not overly explain itself to you. And that ending, as the two houses come together and time gets played backward? Wow.The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. I'm used to being let down by endings and modern horror falling apart by the end. This one hits the landing and effortlessly brings in a very human story of grief without hammering home its point and remembering that at heart, this is a horror movie, and horror movies are supposed to scare us, not just preach at us.Director David Bruckner is going to be making the new Hellraiser and if this is any indication, that movie is going to be interesting.
bad OK, here's the voodoo: a 'loving' husband loves his wife so much that he ventures into voodoo mumble jumble, has sex with and murders lots of chicks to trick a demon who wants to kill his wife???WTF???3 stars for the movie production, zero star for the story.
ok Ended up being disappointed. It's a well made movie, and has a good pace, but not as scary as it was hyped to be. It would have been better without the horror elements and just stuck with mystery/drama. I was also confused as to whether or not it was psychological disguised as supernatural. Were the horror elements suppose to represent her trauma about finding out her husband was a cheater and then killed himself? Was he really a serial killer and his guilt is why he offed himself?
ok This review is for people who either have seen the movie or don't care to and want the gist.A formerly depressed protagonist has just lost her husband to suicide. She continues to live in their shared home and witnesses paranormal activity (or maybe it's just a dream, who knows). She has a very dreary view on life and death because she once clinically died for four minutes and felt "nothing" which depressed her terribly. She believes her depression made her husband depressed and caused his suicide. Later she determines he has lead a secret life sleeping with women who look like her, in a house he built to look like the reverse of their's. Weird. Then later still, she determines he has murdered those women. In a fit of despair she begs the ghost she believes to be her husband to come to her and comfort her in her time of need (one would imagine this is the last thing anyone would actually want... He was murdering women who looked like the protagonist after all... So yeah, that's different). The ghost actually turns out to be a demonic entity which was the "nothing" that the protagonist faced when she clinically died. It is massively butthurt that she survived, even though it's apparently been years or something since the accident. It decides to possess the protagonist's husband in a bid to get her killed so that the Nothing can reclaim her. The husband tricks the Nothing by killing women that look like his wife in the reverse house. Apparently the Nothing is stupid and couldn't tell the difference between houses or women, even after like twenty women are killed. Eventually the husband kills himself to protect his wife... But the Nothing gains control over her anyways and convinces her to almost kill herself.Think for a moment: The Nothing manages to possess her, beat her to an inch of her life and, not force her, but almost convince her to kill herself.So the Nothing literally didn't need the husband AT ALL.The actress was great and the suspense was good, until the story became terribly flawed and stupid. I would've preferred she discovered his double life was really weird and creepy and leave it at that. I honestly thought she was going to find the house with corpses and one victim left alive, and that the house would be booby trapped, or like some intricate maze, filled with puzzles, where she has to rescue the last victim. But no, we got this. As soon as ghosts entered the equation I knew it was downhill from therein. It only gets five stars for the actress and the funky "The Haunting" (1999) style distorting house effects, which is always fun to look at.
ok Well this certainly made me feel uneasy throughout. It was quite intelligently written and featured one of Rebecca Hall's best performances.It scared the hell out of me at times too. It felt refreshing among the genre. I kept trying to guess what would happen next, or solve the various riddles, which is testament to my level of engagement.The jump scares were effective. The entire way it was filmed just enhanced the overall feel of things. At its core, The Night House is a film about grief, in a way that slightly made me think back to The Babadook - though I would prefer this.In saying that, it got a little messed up towards the end and left my head somewhat rattled. Still a solid horror movie that has a lot happening.
good I found out about this film through its movie poster mini-billboard that was on display in the movie house I frequent . I took a photo of it many months before the film was released . The aesthetics of the art work immediately drew me to anticipate this art-house horror. I was not disappointing !Rebecca Hall is tremendous in David Bruckner's tense, twisty cerebral , thought-provoking psychological horror thriller. In The Night House, her impassioned dedication to her craft is on full display. The script affords Rebecca a rich and resonant role, and Hall takes full advantage of this opportunity, delivering what very well may be one of the most memorable female performances in recent horror history. Yes she is that good. I will be seeking out every role she has done.The film follows Beth (Hall), a teacher who was recently widowed after her husband Owen (Evan Jonigkeit) died by suicide. Although sudden solitude can bring about nightmares and uneasiness in its own right, Beth, who suffered with her own crippling depression when her husband was still alive, is convinced that her terrifying dreams and the strange sounds that she hears during her waking hours are not simply due to imagination. As she sifts through her deceased loved one's possessions and discovers clues about his possible secret life, she realizes that there is something more than grief waiting for her in the optical illusions that lie around every corner of the home.The new horror movie The Night House is an unsettling blend of ghost story and psychological terror - the kind of film that leaves audiences wondering what the ending really means. While some jumps are featured here and there ,and are usually effective in their own right ; most of The Night House is designed to unsettle and disturb. The cinematography lends it self to the brooding and malevolent atmosphere splendidly .At the helm by future (Hellraiser) reboot director David Bruckner, is definitely much more in line with a horror movie taking a more cerebral approach, building its scares up slowly, and going for creeping out the viewer over startling them. I think Bruckner is a promising up and comer.The filmmaker puts a formidable visual game of mirrors into practice, which fits beautifully with the story's unsettling conclusion. Enhanced by Rebecca Hall's gripping central performance, The Night House offers atmospheric horror that engages intellectually as well as emotionally. First class horror cinema . 8.5 /10.
ok No surprise that the visuals were breathtaking, some beautiful shots and immersive cinematography. However, there was no depth to the plot. Some lovely character moments.
ok Though the style part was enjoyable on it's own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn't feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I'm not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.
ok Fantastic Beasts 3 is a serviceable follow up to the previous entries in the series. It has a giant Johnny Depp shaped hole in it however and the movie doesn't acknowledge the change. The movie also has holes in it which is obviously caused by all the behind the scenes drama that went with it. Katherine Waterson is reduced to a cameo (whether by choice, i'm not sure) and Erza Miller has barely any dialogue and drops out of the movie for the most part (maybe due to behaviour on the set). There are some nice moments, mostly provided by Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law or Dan Fogler. The creature CGI is terrific as expected of the series and it looks like there will be more Fantastic Beasts in the future.
bad Firing Johnny Depp was a huge and costly mistake. I was actually excited to finally get into the Fantastic Beasts franchise having always been a Harry Potter fan but after learning how little integrity Warner Brothers has I have lost all interest.
ok Rather slow and boring with a politically oriented plot which throttles itself through its design choices. There's lots of spectacular looking CGI and special effects, but most of the action was in dark scenes which made it hard to see what was going on and for all the magic in the film, it had none of the awe or amazement of the Harry Potter films. Some funny moments and the acting and music was ok, but the secrets were underwhelming and although the production value was high, the entertainment level was not.
ok In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.Becoming less and less about the titular beasts that started this Eddie Redmayne lead adventure all the way back in 2016 and more about trying to draw in extra audience engagement and enthusiasm by bringing back known staples such as Hogwarts and a much more prevalent Albus Dumbledore into this latest outing, you can see the battle raging between Fantastic Beasts trying to figure out exactly what it is and who its for and its a battle that isn't won clearly by the conclusion of this third outing, making it a sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages to entertain to decent degree.Without a clear identity or even a character we can truly call our own, with Redmayne's Newt Scamander getting to do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like a bystander to whats going on around him, with new addition Mads Mikkelsen's Grindelwald growing in power and his old acquaintance Dumbledore trying to assemble a crack team to help thwart his plans, Fantastic Beasts is hamstrung by its inability to focus its attention into a specific story arc or character journey, with its drab grey and gloomy sets, dark themes and heavy topics feeling rather unmagical for a film that potentially could've finally shed the shackles of past expectations to really let fly with some inventiveness and spark.There are snippets of such things here, a prison escape and some brief moments spent back in the halls of Hogwarts but for a majority of the films two hour plus runtime there's not a whole lot of memorable moments delivered in Yates film, which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much of Crimes of Grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold of this property and turn it into the possibly great series it could be, something that is unlikely now with two films left to come.While not inspiring much jaw-dropping or magical chills, there's still an undeniable cinematic goodness to Rowling's magic filled universe and there is a feeling here that with Dumbledore building his ragtag group of foot soldiers and with Mikkelsen giving Grindelwald a significant amount of menace and unnerving energy, there's hope yet still that the final chapters of Rowling's mid-tier and seemingly unloved property can still work to a level that will ensure we walk away from the Fantastic Beasts series indifferent in ways but not upset at what's been done to our beloved world of wizards, witches and muggles (and the odd beast or two).Final Say -Still far removed from even the lesser of the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a small step back in the right direction following the crimes of the last entry and while its still not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination, its a passable diversion of anyone with a passing interest in the Harry Potter cannon.3 crab walks out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
ok The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.Writing: 5/10
bad Where to begin with this agonising experience? Its a 2 hour 20 minute film that feels like its twice that length. I think the writers must have been paid per character they introduce, because this film has so many characters they sink the ship that this franchise is.Nothing happens for so long. No one is interesting. We don't care about anything. The saving grace of this film is that the acting across the board is great, but great acting cannot save awful writing.The two good characters are Dumbledore and Newt. Jude Law is great as Dumbledore and, as the title suggests, we learn things about him. Newt is a fun plucky character. I feel bad his Fantastic Beasts series was taken over by this dour slog simulator.The action is messy. There's no stakes to the action because you don't care about anyone. The film jumps from place to place to thing to thing and nothing is interesting. Why do I care about any of these people (apart from my boy Newt).Someone needs to lose the writers and directors for the sequels because all I can say about this series is that its a colossal waste of time.
bad The story is boring and dull, I love Mads, but Johnny was born for this role. No Johnny, no more great scores for you. WB, you deserve only 1s for all of your movies. Trying to be as successful as Marvel/Disney, but failing miserably. Worst end of all the HP movies.
ok Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast "universe" a succes?Well, the main storyline was okey but the rest of it was kinda unimportant and not that interesting..
ok A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.Instead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.Plus the faceless army of Grindelwald's followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn't even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.The whole "we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world"-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn't any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer.
bad I probably managed to stay awake for less than half of this film, if you add up the bits that I endured. Perhaps that means I don't have the right to judge it. But to my mind it accurately reflects the fare on offer. A lot of the dialogue was inaudible. Nothing much happened for long periods. When action does kick in it can be visually stirring, but with so little investment in the characters and their predicament it was not exciting.As I have never been keen on Harry Potter, fans of the franchise may feel they should take these comments with a pinch of salt. But my wife, who loved Harry Potter and dragged me to a number of the films, yawned her way through this and pronounced it poor.
bad I watched this at the cinema, I can't say I'm sorry for the money I gave for tickets, but it almost is. First of all I came to watch a fantastic beast movie, the first two parts were great for me so I thought there would be this one too. Well I was wrong, here the emphasis is on interpersonal relationships, politics, the emphasis is on promoting same-sex sexual orientations (in backgrond) and many other smaller and bigger things that have absolutely nothing to do with either genre or story, very few special effects unlike previous works and very few fantastic beast. Well mostly suppress your enthusiasm and don't expect much this movie is an below average timekiller .. blah.
good Even though it still has a reasonably messy narrative, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a significant improvement over it's disappointing predecessor that actually remembers to be fun and emotionally satisfying with genuinely magical moments.Eddie Redmayne still has the adorably awkward charm and likeability that make him a consistently great lead. Mads Mikkelsen is definitely the best Grindelwald with a more subtle and restrained evil presence.Jude Law is once again an incredible Dumbledore and Dan Fogler is still a really funny scene stealer. Jessica Williams is an amazing new addition with endless charisma and is instantly likeable.David Yates' direction is really good despite having done so many already, still delivering inventive set pieces and great fights. The CG is mostly impressive if a little overused. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent, adding to the overall atmosphere with effective callbacks and heartwarming whimsy.
bad I loved the first two films in the "Beasts" franchise - original, well paced, and with interesting story lines.However, this third installment is slow, confused, with too many plot lines and just plods to a fairly predictable conclusion in half an hour more than it needs to be.This film had significant script problems, and it shows. The originator of the franchise has obviously run out of ideas, and the studio lack the courage to bring someone else in that can take the franchise and keep the quality up.It's said that authors should never adapt their own work, and although this is an original story, rather than from a book. The same reasons are true. The author gets too attached to irrelevant story lines and character arcs, whilst fresh eyes can trim the fat and produce a more coherent work. Added to this is the heavy handed allegory of the rise of European socialism in Germany in the 20s and 30s driven by Rowling's somewhat dubious politics, and it's a recipe for nearly two and a half hours of turgid self-indulgence.It is said that if you love something, set it free. Well, Rowling obviously hates this franchise. She should set it free and let a professional take over.
bad This movie doesn't deserve more than 0. But i gave 1. That's all WB. Every movie from this production shouldn't get more than 1. Lol. And one last thing, Amber Heard sucksðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
ok We've been waiting for this movie for so long and we are so very disappointed with the non-original, empty story line. Many key topics were squeezed into couple of sentences and instead of building a proper story line, it was filled with some magic tricks.Although in general I like Mads Mikkelsen, I didn't think he was a good fit for the role. Depp played a more specific and rememberable character, whereas Mads Mikkelsen was just a simple emotionless 'bad guy' character which I found to be very one-dimentional.All and all, I don't think we will be watching the next movie in the cinema.
bad Boring, broken plot, bad characters, terrible logic. I don't even know why Warner allowed the movie to be shown. I'd rather sleep at home for two hours than waste my time in cinema.
bad I will never watch your movie's in a theatre ever again for replacing Johnny Depp.I love Mads a lot but replacing Johnny Depp went too far. You could have stopped giving him any more roles but you didn't have to replace him.You did not respect for what he was but disrespect him.
good My Review - Fantastic Beasts :
bad Just when I thought it couldn't get any more insulting than The Crimes of Grindelwald - Yates & Rowling outdid themselves in spectacular fashion.What an atrocious, insulting, messy, inconsistent, awkward jumble of a film.Laughable plotlines, non-sensical world and lore building, convenience is at an all time high - and don't get me started on the clear and present merchandising attempts through washed out fan service.Any Harry Potter fan will agree with me when I say that this cash grab of a series needs to die.Annoyingly - it's SO bad that I can't wait to see what bull they try and get away with in the next one.
bad I don't understand what the idea of this movie was. It has a lot of nonsense fit together into a movie that doesn't matter at all. The whole idea of the movie makes no sense.It's such a missed opportunity. I was really sad to see what they did.The best scenes in the movie have been like 5 minutes all together in Hogwarts when it was not about the plot.
ok As a real Potterhead, I watched Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore Premiere in the theatre. After the movie got postponed twice my expectations got higher and I was definitely optimistic about this one. It dissapointed me again. The longest part of the movie is totally unnecessary and boring, filling our heads with some information in a really slow way. The last part of the movie contains few great battles and Harry Potter backstory information so the movie is definitely watchable especially for the Harry Potter fans, but generally the plot barely exists and the whole movie is only a bridge to the new, upcoming one. Just like the last part, The Crimes of Grindelwald, this one contains great visuals and fighting sequences, but awful pacing and a boring plot.
bad The first couple of Fantastic Beasts movies were MUCH better than this although nothing compared to the original Harry Potter series of course. Plot holes galore, boring characters and disservice to the primary FB cast who didn't seem to be as enthusiastic in their roles as they once were. This of course includes the legendary Johnny Depp whom was sorely missed in this film. Mad's performance as Grindelwald was just like any plain and ordinary 'bad guy' with the emotional range of a teaspoon as Hermione once famously said. My favourite parts were when the original 'Harry Potter' themes played although Hogwarts was an utter husk to how it was in the Potter franchise...
good Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore: Mads Mikkelsen takes over as Grindelwald and is very good indeed in the part, at times he's seemingly channeling Hannibal. There is a poignant scene as the film opens though where he meets Dumbledore (Jude Law) over a cup of tea and they philosophise over their lost love but there is no rapprochement. Some great CGI but the action is important as Grindelwald challenges for the position of Supreme Mugwump, Much of the action takes place in a Germany where Grindelwald has subverted it's Ministry of Magic and there are allegories with Nazi Germany as his supporters rally and his Gestapo like goons combat Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his team. A prison rescue sequence has plenty of wonderful creatures and monsters but outstays it's welcome. Still, this film is an improvement on The Crimes of Grindelwald even if it would have benefited from a 15 minute cut in it's running time. Directed by David Yates, written by J. K. Rowling and Steve Kloves. 8/10.
ok CLEANER is somewhat of an enigmatic movie: it starts out as though it is going to be a sassy comedy about a retired cop whose job it is to 'clean up' after homicides (a distinctly messy and repulsive job), turns into a rather grisly crime investigation story, adds a dollop of 'ain't life grand', and finishes as an exposÃ© of police corruption. The story line by Matthew Aldrich is further fragmented by being so full of holes that the audience has to toss credibility overboard in order to make it through, and the method of direction by Renny Harlin can't seem to settle on which style to take. It is all kind of a mess and justifies the straight to DVD move. The saving grace of the film is a cast of stalwart actors who can make even a shaky script palatable. Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a 'retired' cop who makes his living cleaning up the gory remainders of criminal acts of homicide and other grisly crimes. We learn his wife was murdered some years ago, leaving him as a single father of the bright and charming teenager Rose (Keke Palmer). Cutler happens on an assignment to clean a particularly gruesome homicide scene in the home of one Ann Northcut (Eva Mendes in a nicely understated role) and as the convoluted story develops, Cutler realizes that the crime scene represents a culmination of forces that threaten to uncork a long history of police corruption - a history that involves him and his best friend Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris) and the tough Detective Jim Vargas (a terrific Luis GuzmÃ¡n). How the story ties together and ends is too loose to convey and would ruin the minimal drama present. Each of the actors, even the minor roles played very well by such artists as Jose Pablo Cantillo and Robert Forster, give it the full court press. But the see-through script and the jumbled camera work and direction prevent this from being a significant film. Grady Harp
ok The premise of 'Cleaner' is quite clever; a professional cleaner cleans up a crime scene, only to discover that, in spite of original appearances, the police had not recorded the crime at all. Unfortunately, as he tries to find out who has put him up to this, the film descends into regulation clichÃ©. It's not an awful film, but it is the sort of movie in which, shortly after each character appears, you can reliably predict what their ultimate role in the plot will be; and where none of the various twists comes as a real surprise. Everything is improbably connected; there's a beautiful woman (although surprisingly no sex); it all comes down to a personal showdown at the end. It's watchable; but scarcely interesting.
good August 2008 Tom Cutler is a crime scene cleaner Â– his company is contracted to remove the blood and gore left behind when the authorities have removed the bodies. A former cop, Tom is also a widower with a teenage daughter to look after. Tom gets a job like any other and cleans the mess from a bloody murder in a rich neighbourhood so that nothing remains for the family to see. He goes back the next day to find the family home but that they have no knowledge of his work or indeed that anything untoward happened. Trying to contact the cop who gave Tom the job turns out to be a dead end and a fake name, meaning that Tom has effectively deleted all evidence of a murder before anyone else knew about it. When the police launch a "missing persons" enquiry into a high-profile man in a police corruption case, Tom quickly finds himself up to his neck in trouble.The cast attracted me to this and I wondered why, with all these people involved, I hadn't heard of it. Watching it helped me understand why it never came to my attention because it doesn't ever get going before it hurts itself. The concept is good enough as we have a former police officer now cleaning crime scenes used to delete the record of murder. On paper what happens also works well as skeletons come out of the closet and the stakes get higher as Tom nears the truth, however when it comes to delivery on screen, it all falls apart. The opening of the film is brisk enough but when it gets to the point where it has to start doing something (ie specifically when the crime is discovered) the film seems to slip into neutral gear and just coast on as before. As a result we get lots of stuff that don't work and should have been minimised or removed and also lots of stuff that is too average to impress.What I am talking about is the lack of pace and tension in the film; I know that Tom is an older character and that a good thriller doesn't need shouting or running to engage but this film definitely needs some energy injected into it. It drags its way through the plot to the obvious conclusion (and, detail aside, it is pretty obvious) and it never really made me sit up and take notice. A lot of the problem is with the writing because on one hand we clearly have a film that is put together as a thriller but then on the other hand the writer seems keen to drive the film from the characters. Thus we have scenes of domestic troubles, moments with characters revealing things about themselves and, to be blunt, too much talking. It wouldn't matter if the film did this in a way that engaged me but at the same time it is attracting you with the thriller plot so that all this other stuff feels like a waste of time Â– they could have worked together but here they don't.The cast can do nothing with it either, although none of them really help themselves. Considering what better films all those involved have done, it is disappointing to see them struggle or fail in different ways. Jackson appears to have been mis-directed because he is looking for something from within his character instead of just flicking into "thriller mode". Neither the material nor the film rewards this approach and his performance ends up feeling like another distraction. He does work well with Palmer though (who herself is very good) but again this whole side of the film feels like a distraction. Harris is obvious and a bit lazy, while GuzmÃ¡n plays it the way you expect. Mendes is the biggest let-down for me. I know many don't rate her but I think she is good at what she does but, here, she just struggles with her dialogue and character and is about as poor as I think I've seen her.Overall then what we have here is a flat film that never really sparks into life in any regard. The thriller core lacks energy and the associated threads of family etc are not allowed to grow and end up just being distractions. You can see the potential but without decided what it wants to be, general uncertainty has prevented anyone working too hard and has produced a surprisingly sluggish and dull affair.
ok Renny Harlin is a director whose talent seems to have diminished with every film he's made in the last twenty years. He first came to my attention with DIE HARD 2, one of my favourite movies all time, and then delivered a couple more entertaining movies during the 1990s (namely, the ones without Geena Davis: CLIFFHANGER and DEEP BLUE SEA). Since then, his once solid talent seems to be floundering: he made what might be Stallone's worst ever movie, DRIVEN, and then one of the worst films I've seen in a good while: 2006's THE COVENANT. CLEANER is his next film after that, and the good news is that it's better than its predecessor, but still a disappointing outing.The problem is that, despite a fine cast, this film looks and feels like a TV movie. The scripting is the worst thing about it, a sub-standard effort heavily derived from the likes of CSI. Although it's meant to be a thriller, this is a film utterly devoid of thrills; only the strength of the acting kept me watching. There's one good twist at the outset and then everything plays out in a conventional, seen-it-all-before way. The worst thing is the villain reveal, which is so completely expected it's actually wince-inducing, along with the whole reason for that person being the villain as well.Samuel L Jackson is a fine actor who seems to be mired in sub-standard material lately (SNAKES ON A PLANE anyone?). He gives a typically fine performance here, but his considerable talents are wasted. The same goes for Ed Harris, saddled with a nothing role. I was delighted to see Luis Guzman pop up in a larger role than he's usually given, and he's great too, although again wasted. Robert Forster delivers a cameo but the female lead is given to the horrendous Eva Mendes who never convinces for a second. This cold actress never ignites the screen and she's very poor here â€“ although not quite as bad as she is in GHOST RIDER.Aside from the grisly death clean-up scenes (some of which left me feeling distinctly sickened) there's absolutely nothing to remember about this film â€“ it's just another run-of-the-mill outing and nothing to get excited about.
ok This is a fun, relatively forgettable little flick. I saw a documentary on real life cleaners of this sort, and that is a nasty business. Samuel L Jackson does a good job, like he normally does. Cleaner is entertaining, and I think it does a pretty decent job sucking you into the story. Eva Mendes walks around looking like some computer animated hottie (that's just how she looks!) and also gets the job done.OK, let me address the elephant in the living room, here.. How did Renny Harlin go from something easily watchable and entertaining like this, to The Legend of Hercules? I just don't get that. Moving on.Cleaner won't keep you up at night, it probably won't be your all time favorite, but you are entertained while it lasts. Watching Jackson clean and talk about cleaning is pretty fun.
ok The concept of cleaner is really interesting. An ex-cop becoming a crime scene cleaner. It's unique. We usually see ex cops becoming PI's or something similar. It's kinda gross to think about it and even more to see it but it's a real thing so it got my attention. The cast is also excellent. Big names like Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris will always catch your attention. Unfortunately that's where the good ends.The convoluted plot is weak and unbelievable. Corruption, murders, betrayal, vengeance, affairs... it's like a bad telenovela. The ending is as weak as the plot. When the credits roll you're left with the thought of "what the hell was that?"
good Tom Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) is a former police detective, who turned crime scene cleaner. Which he cleans up the mess of people who committed suicide, accidental deaths or murder. After police are done investigate the crime. When Tom does his next clean-up of someone was murder in a high profile mansion. Then he later finds out that he was unwillingly set-up for a cover up. Which his supposedly last client Ann Norcut (Eva Mendes) is starting to ask questions why Tom was in her house, when no one was home. While his former partner (Ed Harris) tries to help Tom with the problem he's facing and while Tom's daughter Rose (Keke Palmer) is trying to ask her father, why her mother was murder awhile back. While the father and daughter relationship proves to be increasingly difficult, since Tom is never quite there for her.Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2:Die Harder, The Covenant, Mindhunters) made an stylish, interesting, sometimes very fascinating film. Harlin's latest film certain matured a lot, after making Hollywood movies they were always Hits or Misses. The visual style of the picture are the highlight. Scott Kaven's (Cabin Fever, the upcoming Paul W.S. Anderson's Death Race) cinematography are also good. The actors in the film gives good performances. The relationship between the father and daughter are one of the best parts in the picture. While the premise of first-time screenwriter Matthew Aldrich is somewhat original but his script could have been more complex.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an interesting audio commentary by the director, deleted scenes and a digital copy of the movie. This might have came straight to DVD in North America but it came out in Overseas in several European countries. Jackson, who's terrific as usual also worked with director Harlin in the underrated "The Long Kiss Goodnight" and the wildly entertaining "Deep Blue Sea". Which Jackson is also one of the producers of this feature. Luis Gusman appears in a small supporting role is always a hoot in any features he has appeared in. Robert Forster appears in a cameo as well. Fans of film noir will be modestly entertained by the movie. Certainly worth a look. Super 35. (*** Â½/*****).
ok What ever happened to Hollywood creativity? There was an interesting idea , about the guy who cleans up the crime scenes and discovers the cover-up of some kind. So far so good, and then it all goes downhill It takes all of grand 5 minutes to completely figure out the whole plot. This movie is ridden with the tritest of clichÃ©s. Characters couldn't be more boring and predictable. And the tragic part is,in all of this you could see the potential for a great thriller. It looks like the talentless, behind the scenes moneymakers, once again asserted their rights and ruined yet another movie. Will someone finally get rid of this morons and let the filmmakers do their job as they seem fit.
ok Actually for once I was disappointed after seeing a Renny Harlin movie because I had high hopes for this one. Usually I've known in advance his movies would be bad but "Cleaner" seemed that it might actually be really good for a change. It's not really bad, but it isn't anything great either.Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris did their job very well in the leading roles and Harlin's direction was also good. Eva Mendes' performance wasn't anything to hooray for though. The movie started off well and I thought to myself: "This might be it. The movie that puts Renny back on the top.", but sadly no. The script is just too basic. You've seen different versions of this script on the screen many many times before. The characters and the world they live in might be totally different, but it's still the same generic plot. One thing that bugged me a bit was the musical score which didn't fit in some places at all.But as far as Harlin's movies go this is one of his better ones. It just needed that original surprise twist in the end that never came. I can't really recommend you go see this in the cinema, but it's worth a rent.
ok Cleaner is a surprisingly boring and lackluster movie beautifully photographed. The casting is superb and would seem to be a sure recipe for cinematic success--Samuel L. Jackson, Ed Harris, Eve Mendes and Luis Guzman. The dialog is decent and well acted. The plot is where this movie just completely drops the ball.The plot begins mildly unbelievably--A crime scene cleaner becomes unwittingly immersed in the cover up of a homicide--and then just snowballs downhill from there into a huge police cover-up (I don't want to "spoil" anything for any potential viewers) with an unbelievable plot twist and then ends in a thoroughly stupid and highly implausible ending.The upside and downside is this movie is beautifully filmed and with such talent, thought and effort that the cinematography itself keeps you thinking it has to get better and it only gets worse.I hope Ed Harris got paid a lot of money to do this film! Ed does a great job with the little he has to go with and proves what a great actor he is. Eva Mendes does a poor job playing a recent widow to murdered husband (is she angry/sad/sexy/conspiratorial/or just a gold-digger who married a sugar daddy who just got knocked off?). Luis Guzman does a solid job as usual.I seem to enjoy the movies where Samuel L. Jackson plays a supporting role or shares the lead rather than being the sole lead e.g. Pulp Fiction, The Negotiator, A Time To Kill, etc... In Cleaner he does a reasonable job with a poor plot until the end where his acting coupled with a bad plot twist left me wondering what I could have done better with the time it took to watch Cleaner.All in all I wish this cast and DoP would have had a better script. I would recommend that Matt Aldrich stick to acting and give up the script-writing. As I think everything was done well except for the storyline/plot aka the script. I give kudos to Renny Harlin (director) for a job well done.
ok There are quite a few films made. that for some reason or another go direct to DVD,playing in a few theatres in Europe.Viewing this tonight I can see why, they decided NOT to play this in any USA theatre. They would have needed a CLEANER to clean the mess.Matthew Aldrich's first screenplay may be his last,it starts with a good idea & goes downhill from that point on; the script was confusing, clichÃ© ridden & above all not very interesting.The director Reny Harlin was of no help here,He is far from a real good director BUT here he completely misses the boat.The cast is top draw & usually reason enough to see them in a movie, Samuel Jackson, Ed Harris, Eve Mendes & Luis Guzman do the best they can with what they have to work with.I also want to mention the fine performance by 14 year old Keke Palmer, She plays the daughter of Sam Jackson & is just excellent.If this had a more thought out script & better direction it could have been much better,.Ratings ** (out of 4) 62 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)
ok I had very low expectations for this movie. Renny Harlin hasn't made a decent movie in many years so I expected the usual crap, but i was very surprised. It had good plot, very nice acting and was well made. Samuel L. Jackson plays a retired police officer who has a "Cleaning company". He cleans up murder scenes and other scenes of death. One day he does a job in a mansion and gets trapped in a web of deceit.The Movie unfolds in a low key, unusual for Renny, which usually has lot of noise and action in his movies :) It has lot of blood though(not surprising given the title...) So basically this movie is a good way to spent hour and half. Hopefully Renny boy is out of the slums....
ok Samuel Jackson is a former police detective who now is a cleaner; he goes into houses where people have died and remove the grit, grime, microbes and, when it's a violent death, blood. he gets a job in the suburbs, goes there, and finds evidence of murder. He documents it, cleans it, and the next day returns to find home owner Eva Mendes at a loss for his presence. She's concerned about her missing husband.Given the small cast of prominent performers, including Ed Harris as Jackson's former partner, Luis Guzman as a detective involved in a case involving Miss Mendes' missing husband, and Robert Forster as the guy in charge of the morgue, there isn't that much of a mystery; in addition, director Renny Harlin offers the audience a shot to give the duller members of the audience the answer. The script by Matthew Aldrich makes sure the subtext is never out of sight. Jackson's job is to make the unpleasant past vanish; he is trying to blank out the events that led to his leaving the police force. It's a waste of some fine actors.
ok Last seen together in "The Spirit", Samuel L Jackson and Eva Mendes are cast again in a thriller that sports an interesting concept, only to have that concept crumble towards the end, chunk by chunk. Not surprising then, that having worked with Jackson twice before, director Renny Harlin steps out of the action league for something along the lines of a whodunit crime thriller.For the most part, Jackson delivers in his role as a retired police detective currently in the business of cleaning up gruesome remains of the dearly departed. Could the title have been any more original? As Tom Cutler, his narration during the opening credits takes us through the repulsive and often overwhelming process of cleaning up a crime scene after forensics have taken away the corpse. As with most cases of death, natural or unnatural, the body is usually taken away for further examination by the coroner, leaving the next of kin to deal with the unsightly job of cleaning whatever remains are left at the scene of death. This is where Cutler comes in, a self employed private cleaner paid by the grieving next of kin to have blood, gore and other fluids spotlessly removed. On one such assignment, Cutler meticulously refurbishes the scene of a blood splattered homicide to its original setting only to learn shortly after, that the cleaning order did not come from the family of the deceased. Complicating the scenario is the absence of a dead body, with the wife of the supposed victim not being aware of a cleaning order in the first place. Realizing that he may have inadvertently destroyed evidence of homicide, Cutler confides in best friend and ex-partner detective Eddie Lorenzo. While Lorenzo (Ed Harris) and Cutler dig deeper into the mystery, they stumble across an increasingly evident case of police corruption of the highest order, a case in which Ann Norcut's (Eva Mendes) missing husband may be been a victim of. In the ensuing plot twist, Cutler establishes a motive, but not before establishing a link between Ann Norcut, Eddie Lorenzo and a ledger of cops on the take. From a directional perspective, Harlin's attempt at a genre outside his league is undeniably fresh and almost flawless. His use of under toned cinematography evoking a dark atmosphere intentionally disguises the film's secret of a murder most foul. Casting is also stellar with an exceptional performance from Harris, spot on chemistry between Jackson and Keke Palmer in an unstable father-daughter relationship and one of the best roles played out by Luis Guzman as the all too suspicious yet tough detective Jim Vargas. What undermines the potentiality of this being a superb thriller is the total disregard given in founding a solid plot. Not matter what the positives are here, the plot fails to carry its own weight and comes crashing through the roof in a disappointingly predictable second half. All said and done, figuring out who the killer is won't require any special powers of deduction, the biggest mystery perhaps is trying to figure out if the killer had an accomplice and if so, what becomes of this accomplice. Numerous other holes aside, the main problem may be the direction the plot takes, where Jackson's narration in the beginning suggests an indication of dark humor, whereas Palmer's narration in the end suggests something else altogether. In the end, what could have become a sensational whodunit along the lines of "L.A. Confidential", gets reduced to a half baked has-been, any 'Nancy Drew' fan would rather not write home about.
ok As a finnish movie fan, it's always interesting to see a new film from Renny Harlin. Especially when Samuel L. Jackson, one of the most distinctive actors ever, is in it.Jackson plays a crime scene cleaner, which you think would be what this movie is surrounded on. With all the C.S.I. stuff out there, it might interest some. But the scene where the story starts actually tastes like an idea where to start the story, not a theme for a movie where to excavate.The plot is an uninspiring one, from the beginning to the end. There are some attempted details and twists to bring some life and excitement to this story. I'm sorry to say they really fail. There is no depth in this movie, and every attempt to create some is exactly that - an attempt.This is bad cause the acting is pretty and the directing is nice. I can't really understand what the director saw in this script. Maybe the idea of creating something without special effects and exploiting the CSI-thing.I give this one 6/10. All points going to actors and the director.The movie is categorized as "Crime / Thriller". If you want anything good (and new) like that I suggest you see "Awake".
ok Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a former cop who now works cleaning up bloody crime scenes. He's a widower taking care of his teen daughter Rose (Keke Palmer). Cherie (Maggie Lawson) is his assistant. His latest job is a bloody scene at a mansion. The next day, he returns to find the homeowner Ann Norcut (Eva Mendes) completely unaware of what happened. Her husband is reported missing later. Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris) is Tom's friend still on the force. Det. Jim Vargas (Luis GuzmÃ¡n) is investigating the missing man. It turns out that the man is about to testify against police corruption.Director Renny Harlin is competent but his style feels too limited. This has the look of an indie crime thriller with a lot of A-list talents. The Polaroid really threw me off and bug the heck out of me. This is definitely not a period piece. So why the Polaroid and where does he get the film? The tension is kept on a low boil. The problem is that the movie keeps secrets which seems very obvious. It makes the movie feel predictable. It's better off to lay out all the cards much earlier. It would allow the movie to build tension instead of wasting time trying to piece together Tom's history. If the audience is allowed to be on the same level as Tom, they would be allowed into the investigation. It also needs more action to heighten the tension.
ok A few years ago there was an incredible segment on NPR's "This American Life" about a cleaner of crime scenes. Shortly thereafter, Pruitt Taylor Vince played a character that felt indebted to this NPR piece on "C.S.I." ("Swap Meet"). The bringing together of science and death was perfect for the CBS show. I wasn't so sure if such a character could survive a Renny Harlin film.Pity poor Renny Harlin. It still feels that he's trying to recover from CUTTHROAT ISLAND (1995). His last few films have been lucky to even snag a U.S. theatrical release (MINDHUNTERS wasn't one of these), much less a festival screening. So, that must mean that Harlin is back on top, right? Yes and no.That CLEANER is playing a film festival is a vote of confidence in the Finnish filmmaker. Yet, CLEANER is a strange choice for a festival program. It's very much a straight-forward thriller along the lines of KISS THE GIRLS or U.S. MARSHALLS. The presence of Samuel L. Jackson, Ed Harris, and Luis Guzman certainly does well to give the film some credibility and solid performances (though Eva Mendes feels completely out of her league). The script by Matthew Aldrich is a solid, albeit fairly predictable, effort and Harlin does a capable workman's job bringing it to life. I won't object to seeing this one again on cable.
ok i was really looking forward to watching this when it came out,, now it wasn't a bad movie mind ya,, just wasn't quite what i hoped for coming from Samuel Jackson, and Ed Harris, now Eva Mendez can't act worth a hill of beans,, yeah she's hot but that's not enough for me in this movie. Reny Harlin directed this,, so that's part of the reason i thought with the star power of harris and jackson combined with Harlin that it would be better, you got a crime scene cleaner who unknowingly erases all of the evidence of a murder. you got a a retired cop jackson who is the crime scene cleaner,,going up against harris the current cop on the force,, i think mainly eva mendes's character is just for show,, let's call it eye candy. there is a pretty good mystery here at the beginning but there is something i don't quite know but it's just missing from this movie,, maybe not enough suspense, or action,, just can't seem to put my finger on it .
ok The good: only during the FIRST HOUR it is a great mystery thriller story with great acting performances. I really was into it until the first hour had passed...The bad: however good and mysterious the story is during the first hour, after 1 hour though the story tanks and becomes gibbledigook unbelievable. The very ending is totally ridiculous. Such a shame. I had seen this movie before, but still had a vague memory something was wrong with it and NOW I remember again (too late) what was wrong with it: the silly stories' plot turns, halfway through...The story: Samuel L Jackson is a crime scene cleaner, who suddenly becomes the main suspect of a crime scene he has cleaned. Did he do it? If not, who is framing him?
good Just checked Renny Harlin's data in IMDb and this movie (which completely departs in quality and style from his previous work) is NOT mentioned, can anyone correct this please? About the movie itself, great detail in photography, many small takes that help make it much more enjoyable, good music, Jackson and Harris great performers as always, although Mendez is not as convincing in her role, maybe it's that I have never perceived her as a very good actress, but if the intention was to pass her as a subtle femme fatale then I guess she's worth checking out. The girl playing Tom's daughter does not feel completely convincing as a troubled young woman, maybe this is more the director's fault than a lack of talent from the actress' part. Mr. Guzman's parts are very intense, this guy almost always steals the scene in which he appears, we have seen him grow steadily in each movie and he really delivers.
bad It starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specialized in cleaning up crime scenes. As a former cop, he runs into some strange situation, when one job does suddenly "offically vanish". Furthermore, he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper he gets into the background of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in an suspenseful story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 of 10 stars). SPOILER:::: Suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot-out, involving the 14-year old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development... why not having Cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship? or having the daughter discovering some facts? or ... many possible much better story finishes are imaginable... a truly wasted ending!
ok Directed by Renny Harlin, "Cleaner" is slow moving but only 84 min or so runtime crime-drama. It doesn't brake any ground story or plot-wise, but is fairly interestingly narrated and played by protagonist Samuael L Jackson. There seemed to be too much reliance on showing blood and crime scenes as a grotesque sort of mood or setting tool. That kind wears thin being overused in the movie. However there is a decent amount of character development for Harris, Jackson, and Keke Palmer (satisfactorily playing Jackson's on-screen daughter). The main problem though I had towards the end was supposedly Mendez somehow romantically involved with a Harris character almost twice her age - didn't make sense or hold water. Still the movie manages to set a foreboding mood, and makes good of the locations. Music is serviceable as well. Give it a 6/10
good this thriller is way superior to many other recent ones. i would not say "one of the best" because its entertainment aspects are not as high as the artistic ones at face value , or vice versa depending on anyone's moods or interests; after reading the previous reviews i was expecting some dumb plot@co...but no; beside the great acting all around, i found the plot to be quiet genuine for this genre, with a quiet REALIST twist and END ; as who actually "wins" or/and "looses". i can not find anything that is obvious, questions such as "it does not make sense?!", etc, as COMPARED with MANY another similar thrillers.this feature does not have "expected" "punch lines" but then again Samuel L. Jackson is a "punch" in himself))).basically this is an INVESTIGATIVE crime-thriller. it goes great at making the viewer asking "who", "why", "by whom", and so on, in a quiet "classic" way. however the viewer must keep track of story line as much as the visual. the one remarkable way i found this feature quiet original is its takes on the "twists"; the end is unorthodox for the moral and ethical person, and i can only presume this is the reason why the production-plot is-are considered "poor". myself i do agree that those moral and ethical values should be uphold in movies that CONSIDER/UPHOLD/PROMOTE themselves as TEACHING/DOCUMENTARIES.... but for a THRILER i am more then satisfied with the outcome here, that makes perfect sense and has a quiet high dose of reality towards anyone that might have heard/was involved in anything remotely close to this (movie's plot).the movie MISSES action scenes(i do not think there is anything BUT a single shooting and a thrown punch), but the actors and viewers thoughts will likely keep you interested if you want to get to the "bottom of this". i was not really impressed by anyone particularly, everyone was just as good as I EXPECTED from them = great.i can recommend this to anyone looking for or into better then average thrillers. for an investigative viewer this might be right up the alley REGARDLESS of how ANYONE thinks of "how" this movie "should" end...being a critic does not necessary make everyone a screenwriter or a producer, hehehe. however if you looking for butt-kicking or anything "scarry"(altrough there are a couple of frightful scenes but as in raising your interests not your "fear") this is NOT for you.
ok **SPOILERS** Making a very good living running a business involved in cleaning up crime scenes messes retired cop Tom Cutler is called over to the swanky section of town to clean up the mess left by John Norcut. Norcut had his brains, and everything else in his head, splattered over the living room furniture in what seems to be a mob hit-job.With no one answering the doorbell and in Tom finding the house-key under the doormat he makes himself at home cleaning up he place of all the blood and brain matter left by the killer who offed the unfortunate and very unlucky Mr. Norcut. It's the very next day when Tom came over to the Norcut residence to get paid for his services that he finds out from a surprised Mrs. Ann Norut that he was never called to the place and in fact the address he got, which is the same place that he's in now, is totally different from the one the Norcuts reside it!Getting in touch that evening with his good friend in the police department and former partner Det. Eddie Leronzo for a couple of drinks Tom finds out that this Mr. Norcut was in fact the bag-man for indited Police Commissioner Robert Vaughn who's to testify against Vaughn's at his upcoming corruption trial. With Norcut later reported missing by his wife Ann it becomes very evident to Tom, who realizes that he was murdered, that he was used by whoever murdered John Norcut to unwittingly clean up the evidence that would connect him to Norcut's murder! And at the same time framing Tom by being at the crime scene, and cleaning it up, for it! ***SPOILERS*** Tom soon learns, after Norcut's body was found and identified, from Ann that her husband had a secret list of every dirty and underhanded deal made by Commissioner Vaughn and the badge numbers of all the cops who were involved in committing them! Which included non other then Tom himself! Tom was on Vaughn's payroll and was involved in having the man who murdered his wife murdered in prison in retaliation! This has Tom's 14 year old daughter Rose, Keke Palmer, in finding out about her mom's killer being killed in prison feel that her dad, in being responsible for it and keeping it from her all these years, was no better then the criminals that he dealt with while a policeman!It soon comes out that all this slimy and criminal involvement with former Commissioner Vaughn by John Norcut as really a cover for the real reason behind his brutal murder! John Norcut's killer had a much deeper and personal reason for offing Norcut that had to do with his wife Ann whom he was having an affair with! And the most shocking revelation about it wasn't the affair with Norcut's wife Ann, or him finding out about it, that made John Norcut's soon to be killer go wacko! But what resulted from it!
good Greetings again from the darkness. It's often fun when an innovative filmmaker turns a stodgy genre upside down and offers us a new take. And who better to flip over the frequently stale mode of romantic-comedies than Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier? Co-written with his frequent collaborator Eskil Vogt, the film could also be described as a dramady or a thirty-ish coming-of-age tale. Regardless of the label, it's entertaining and thought-provoking, as well as being a bit dark in parts (some of these also being quite funny). This is being called the final film in Trier's "Oslo Trilogy", three loosely connected films including REPRISE (2006) and OSLO, AUGUST 31 (2011).Each of the films represents quite a shift in tone, and this latest revolves around Julie, played exceptionally well by Renate Reinsve. Trier structures the film as 12 chapters plus a prologue and epilogue. The prologue is brilliant and allows us to quickly grasp what we need to know about Julie. She changes her life goals multiple times - from doctor to psychologist to photographer, and later while working in a bookstore, she decides to be a writer. Thankfully we are spared the details in her essay on oral sex in the #MeToo era. Julie is impulsive to a fault. She has confidence but can't commit to a direction - she's confident in her uncertainty.As she approaches 30, Julie is struggling to find her way. She's not so much lost as struggling to deal with her jumbled thoughts. Can you lose your identity if you haven't yet formed one? That seems to be the crux of Julie's inner-struggles, even as she finds a seemingly good fit for a partner. Aksel (a terrific Anders Danielsen Lie) is a successful graphic artist, and he seems to understand Julie. Their relationship builds over time, even as their individual visions and goals diverge. The best life partner still comes with challenges when you still aren't sure who you are as a person.Julie feels herself slipping away, and that's when her impulsive nature reappears. During a special event for Aksel, she walks out and spontaneously crashes a local wedding reception. This leads to a meet cute and flirty time with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). Both he and she are in steady relationships, but only Bill Clinton could determine if the time Julie and Eivind spend together is cheating or not. Ms. Reinsve perfectly captures the spirit of Julie. Although she's often a bit flustered, when she does smile, she radiates like a young Shelley Fabares.Much has been made of Ms. Reinsve's performance and she certainly deserves the accolades. However, we shouldn't overlook the outstanding work of Anders Danielsen Lie in a difficult role. Filmmaker Joachim Trier's previous work also includes THELMA (2017) and LOUDER THAN BOMBS (2015), and his creativity is most welcome. Two sequences stand out in his latest. In one, the world shifts into 'freeze frame' mode as Julie runs through the streets of Oslo to find her new love, and in the second, we follow her in the midst of a drug hallucination after experimenting with mushrooms. In the story, Trier focuses on the dynamics between partners and how the stages of life can complicate things. It's charming and funny, but also quite serious, as he certainly doesn't buy into the ideal that movies must have happy endings. In regard to the title, rather than describe Julie, it's more likely meant to explain how many people think of themselves as they make decisions and mistakes - it's really a show of humanity. And quite a good one.Opening in limited theaters on February 4, 2022.
good Renate Reinsve is giving one of the performances of the year in this turbulent movie about what it's like being alive.I came home from this and told my wife how much it reminded me of "Annie Hall" at times. And then later I was reading a profile of the writer and director, Joachim Trier, which mentioned that "Annie Hall" specifically was a huge inspiration for him as a film maker. So there you go.Is Reinsve the worst person in the world? Hardly. She's a warm, loving woman, trying to figure out how to give love to others and yet get what she needs and feels she deserves herself. What happens when those two things seem mutually exclusive? Welcome to human relationships.The movie is very funny in its first half, and then gets very sad in its last half. But it's never emotionally manipulative. It makes the case that it's ok to look out for yourself and your needs, but also that part of growing as a person is learning that the world isn't all about you.Grade: A.
ok February 2022 An achingly human & frighteningly accurate portrait of an entire generation's existential crisis, The Worst Person in the World observes millennial angst through a young woman's quest for love & meaning as she enters into her 30s without any idea about her identity & purpose in life. Crafted with flair & told with utmost honesty, this contemporary rom-com is one of the better films of the year.Co-written & directed by Joachim Trier, the story is narrated in chapters and covers her four years journey of love & enlightenment in which we see her throw herself into different career paths & new relationships yet never going all the way. While most episodes are interesting & aptly address the film's themes, few of them are way too brief and should've been either left out or integrated with others.The first half is lighthearted & brimming with a restless, radiant spirit while the later chapters deal with heavier themes and are treated with required seriousness. Renate Reinsve anchors the film with a performance that hits the right emotional notes and is thoroughly convincing. Anders Danielsen Lie & Herbert Nordrum also chip in with strong support and their chemistry with Reinsve is seamless & spot-on.Overall, The Worst Person in the World is a downright sincere & thoroughly engrossing effort that renders the humanity of its characters with authenticity & compassion. Heartbreaking yet not without hope, this Norwegian dramedy understands the dreaded existential cul-de-sac that comes from not knowing who you are or where you fit in as well as the the crushing feeling of playing a supporting role in your own life story.
good It's been a couple of hours since I watched this, and I'll admit, it's been hard to figure out how to give some thoughts on it through text.I will say it resonated with me emotionally- far more than your average movie. I really felt it, y'know? Not in a way that's going to make me reshape my life or change what I'm doing day to day necessarily, but there was something to it that makes me sure it's going to stick in my brain for weeks, maybe months or even years to come.I can't go much further than that. It's a wonderful, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes soul-crushing film, and all the emotions are explored and interweaved perfectly.There are so many great scenes... the scene where time freezes, the "what is cheating" scene, the scene in and around the hospital, the scene with the magic mushrooms... it's almost like every single chapter in the film is a highlight, and it all fits together almost perfectly.It's a special film- the more I think about it, the better it gets, and the more it resonates. Also features some of the best acting I've seen in a while from its two leads, Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen Lie. They're so compelling it's almost alarming how invested you get in their characters, maybe because they begin to feel like real people, at a point. Especially in the last half-hour or so- I was blown away by how real they felt, and how easily I believed that these two characters had known each other for years.Might be a 5/5 on a rewatch, in all honesty. Life being tough and all at the moment, I was distracted by some of my own problems while watching these fictional characters deal with theirs. But the moments of crossover were extremely cathartic, and as a film, it flows so well, and didn't feel two hours long, despite having pacing that wasn't afraid to slow down from time to time.Well, how about that.I actually wrote quite a lot.Good films will do that to you.
good The heroine ofJoachim Trier's latest film 'The Worst Person in the World' (2021) is about 30 years old, but she still hasn't managed to find a profession that would give full meaning to her life, or the man she would like to be with and spend the rest of her life, or what could make her happy. It is, if you wish, the film of her searches and the failure of these searches in a hurried and individualistic world. This contemporary Norwegian counter-heroine is one of the most complex and interesting female characters I have seen on screen in recent years. Renate Reinsve's formidable performance brought her a well-deserved award for female performance at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the important reasons, but not the only one for which this film is worth seeing.Julie (Renate Reinsve) is an intelligent and intellectually gifted young woman. She starts studying medicine and then gives up, starts studying psychology and abandons this as well, decides to become a photographer and works in parallel and as a bookseller at a bookstore. Her parents are divorced, she is closer to her mother (who is worried about her daughter's un-decisions) while her distant and indifferent father is a negative model that probably makes her wary of relationships with men. And yet she falls in love, not with one man but with two: with a comics book writer and cartoonist about 14 years her senior who wants a child and with a seller at a pastry shop who wants to have fun and maybe to get rid of his previous girlfriend who is more interested by ecology and vegetarianism. Time passes, life advances, but it is not clear in which direction.I guess that one of 'Joachim Trier's sources of inspiration are Woody Allen's older and newer films. The organization of the story in 12 chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue, the well-matched use in this case of off-screen voice, the relationship between lovers separated by age gap, the presence of parents in the lives of mature people, all these they reminded Allen. Even the almost exclusively urban setting seems inspired by his films, with a local touch, of course. If you haven't visited Oslo (like me) by the time you finish watching this movie you will feel the desire to visit this city, which looks colorful, sophisticated, and ... warm (most of the story seems to take place in the summer). The location in time is clear, thanks to the pandemic masks that the characters wear in the epilogue. Just count a few years back. There are at least two chapters in the film with original cinematography that fits well into the logic of the story - the imaginary or real encounter between lovers looking for and finding each other with the rest of the world frozen around and the sequence of the 'experimentation' with hallucinogenic mushrooms. 'The Worst Person in the World' is the story of an imperfect woman with an imperfect life, as are the lives of most of us, a woman who is certainly not the worst person in the world, and the film about her is made interestingly and well acted. Recommended viewing.
ok ... and curtailed expectations in a world of fraught distractions, shallow depths and contradictions. Which is the feeling you get after being pulled through Julie's world and the not so original way she lives it, although it starts with some ambition but just cools and tempers through attrition, wearing thin towards the end, she would drive most men around several bends.
good Sometimes a film cuts deep into your soul - in the best way possible. It happened to me in 2012 with 'Amour'. I wasn't right for a week after seeing that film. 'The Worst Person in the World' has a similar quality. Ultimately it is just showing the harsh realities of life. But man do they hit hard. This film is incredible.This film wouldn't be what it is without Renate Reinsve. I haven't seen all of the Best Actress nominees for the Oscars this year yet, however I'd be shocked if all five could justify their place over her. She is mesmerising to watch. She puts everything she has out there. It is as fearless and captivating as performances come. I'm so glad she won Best Actress at Cannes.The entire cast is great but I have to mention Anders Danielsen Lie specifically as well. He plays a crucial role in this film being what it is. It's a truly excellently written role to be fair, but he still plays his part in bringing it to life. He's the character that a lot of men who watch this film are going to relate to.The dialogue in this film is on another level. It is so deep and thoughtful. The amount of lines that resonated with me were huge. The film never feels like it is trying too hard to impress anything upon you either. It simply puts stuff out there, and it just so happens that the stuff is so good it hits you like a freight train.If someone asked me what this film was about I think I'd find that a very hard question to answer. I guess the best answer would just be "life". Maybe it won't resonate with everyone else like it did with me (although the film seems to be getting a lot of positive feedback which I'm stoked about) but I don't think many could watch this masterpiece and not get something out of it. 10/10.
ok Certain films are very difficult to review. One such type, is a very well made film in which you absolutely hate the protagonist- and that dislike may or may not be what you are meant to feel in the directors eyes. "The Worst Person In the World" is exactly that kind of experience for me. I was not reminded of "Annie Hall", as were many, but rather imagine John Schlesinger's "Darling" if Diana Scott had no ambition or even, perhaps, a if Lewis Gilbert's "Alfie" with no balls (to at least own his bad behavior in the end).Julie (as in Julie Christie?) is an unrepentant narcissist who may seem to some to be wandering aimlessly through her late twenties/early thirties. She lives by the seat of her pants- first jumping from major to major in college and then from man to man. The film settles on two relationships in particular to follow. But Julie is not totally aimless, she makes choices based on her own level of priority. When she feels insecure in some way- she moves on. Not cutting it in Med school? Try Psychology. Boyfriend's getting so famous that no one notices you? Flee the party and crash a wedding in which you pretend to be someone important (a Doctor) so you can lecture others on child rearing.I wish I could say that as she gets older she gains insight- unfortunately, after leaving the "famous" boyfriend for the "barista" one she finds herself pregnant. Upon hearing that Aksel, the famous on, is dying of an incurable disease she feels she must go to him. She must go to him-while he is near death and ask him to help her with HER problem. Never mind he is pain, never mind he wanted desperately to have a baby with her, it's all about her problem. I thought it was one of the cruelest scenes I'd ever seen- but Renate Reinsve plays it like an innocent babe. Her great performance is something to behold- she's so good that many viewers seem to think she's a good person.The movie cuts her a major break by giving her a miscarriage- where we all knew what the fate of that baby was going to be. When Aksel tells her she would be a "great mother" I almost choked. Just because someone is dying doesn't necessarily give them any special knowledge of the truth-perhaps he loved her, so it's possible he believed this- but he was also pretty smart.This, therefore is my dilemma . If the film is, indeed, about a totally self absorbed woman who's life is skipping past her while she remains in a perpetual adolescence- then I say add two stars to make it an eight out of ten. Maybe it's a generational thing. Young people seem to find this funny- I'm not exactly sure what was funny. They also see her as "loving"-perhaps that's what passes for love these days. I just thought the title was meant sarcastically- but ,at least when I was 30 ,she would've been a contender.
good Joachim Trier's "rom com for people who hate rom coms" is framed by shots of his 30-year-old heroine, a contemporary Miss Julie (Renate Reinsve) whose unduly harsh self-appraisal provides the film's title.By the way, this Julie is not that bad. Just an example of Millennial Malaise. Over the narrative's four years she goes through a restless search for her true self, two off-kilter love affairs, a pregnancy and miscarriage and finally a modest stability. It's all between - and in - those two shots.In the first she stands at the center of the screen, looking to our right. She is elegantly dressed and smoking - the idle center of her world. In the last shot she's seated at her worktable on the left side, facing left, working st her craft and current identity - photography. This is after her first lover has died of cancer and the second gone back to his wife and baby.Initially Julie tastes several careers - doctor, psychologist, art photographer, part-time bookseller, commercial photographer. The last shot leaves her functioning but at a careful remove from any vaunting idealism, as satirized in Eivind's absurdly activist Suvinna: "Batteries had blood on their hands. The sum of Western guilt sat beside him on the couch." As an on-set stills photographer Julie is at the fringe of the art-making life-probing world in which she engages us, indeed exists. The center proves peripheral.Julie's two affairs update traditional screwball comedy. She and cartoonist Aksel "fell in love" at the moment he ends their budding relationship because he's 10 years older than she is and hence with different focus.However more secure in himself, even his starry career is fractured by opposite forces. His comics indulge the antics of an obscenely macho bobcat (heir to the Fritz cat extension of the great Krazy). But the feature film adaptation violates his vision by neutering his character for the Christmas season. Aksel is equally helpless - but far less rewarded - when his TV turns into a feminist attack on the violence and sexism of his work. His cancer becomes a fatal emblem of that rot.In classic screwball style, Julie meets the married Eivind when she crashes a wedding. Having vowed not to betray their mates, they work out an intimacy without sex. That begins in their shared toilet stall scene and ends in Julie's shower miscarriage. Equally offbeat, they appear to establish their hectic romance in the few seconds it takes Aksel to pour her coffee.Julie ends both relationships because she can't fully feel or express herself in them. "Everything we feel, we have to put into words. Sometimes, I just want to feel things." She masterfully leads a man into explaining - thus exemplifying - "mansplaining." While Aksel mutters on, Julie is struck that at 30 she still identifies with young Bambi, insecure on ice. She both loves and doesn't love Aksel so feels she's playing a supporting role in her own life. So her fringe job in film at least sharpens her focus.This film's exploration of the modern woman is a salutary alternative to the mainstream Julie observes, which focuses exclusively on men and their issues. "Personally, I feel like I know everything about male problems. Erectile dysfunction, morning wood, infatuation with young women, premature ejaculation. It's in all the books and movies. Where's the menstrual period? Female orgasm and desire? Where?" As she observed her fellow students earlier, "Norway's future spiritual advisers" are "Mostly girls with borderline eating disorders."
ok Reading the other reviews I am amazed polarizing this film seems to be. When I watched the film a few days ago at the Viennale (Vienna International Film Festival), I would never have thought that it could breed controversy. My feelings about it lie somewhere in between those comments. I never felt it to be boring but I also never thought it groundbreaking in any way. The film, especially in the beginning, has a light approach to the story, almost as if taking its main protagonist not too serious. The narration and chapter style enhances this impression. There are many, quite entertaining, cinematic ideas and moments, most remarkable the long "freeze" sequence and some animation scenes. I found those very fitting in a positive sense since the aim of the character was to find her own way of being. The male versus female relationship question about prospects, identity, future are discussed at length. Sexism is also a theme that creeps up. The film develops a deeper meaning toward the end while the final episode was a kind of let down experience which I don't want to elaborate, otherwise I would need to mark this with spoiler alert.The acting of all is first class and touching, but why there is such an excitement on the side of the critics eludes me.
ok 7/10 - I was honestly expecting more from this buzzy Norwegian drama that in my opinion, had a stellar start but only a serviceable conclusion which soured what could have been a truly great film.
bad February 2022 Renate Reinsve as Julie, in writer/director Joachim's impressive dramedy, The Worst Person in the World, won best actress at Cannes in one of the smartest coming-of-age romantic comedies ever. Yes, and that includes Greta Gerwig or for a different take, Nora Ephron.Regardless of my allusions and illusions, just enjoy one of the best performances of the year, as she deftly plays the vagaries of a 20-something trying to fall in love and consider career choices that make sense for a heroine who has interest in medicine, psychology, and photography. An early fantasy scene where the world stops and she can do what she wants without consequences best expresses the Gen-Y hope of an uncomplicated life.She's unusually talented but held back by difficult choices and relatives like a drunken, estranged dad. In her ever-changing love life, she does time with a successful graphic artist, Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), and Eivind (Herbert Nordrum), whose notions about having a child help shape her future as a potential mother. The boys represent the challenges of any youngster with talent and not a clue where to go with it.More than the themes which writers Trier and Eskil Vogt offer in spare, Nordic style, is the emerging character of Millennial Julie, approaching 30, whose mother can only suffer ineffectually about Julie's abrupt career changes (Julie started out as a highly-ranked med student after all). As she begins to make a career of photography, she figuratively sees her life more sharply and contends with sticky decisions about having a baby and the like.The Worst Person in the World is one of the best dramedies this year and a fresh addition to that well-worn genre. In other words, she is not the worst person in the world nor are you for indulging your romantic urges.
ok She doesn't cares about anybody else, her feelings is the most important thing. She feels her problem is the biggest problem in the world without even have working problem, starving, caught in the war or any REAL problems. She want more but do nothing except hurting everybody who loved her. Good direction tough to show how Selfish at its finest can happen.
ok They keep describing her as young woman who can't decide what she wants in life. She's at or near 30 for most of the film. Is that young? Anyway, a dozen or so escapades in the life of julie. Most not all that interesting. Or "funny". You keep wondering what's so fascinating about her. Having said that, i have to tell you i haven't seen acting this good in a very long time. The main characters. Julie, aksel and eivind are all wonderful. See this movie for them.
ok The Worst Person In The WorldThis movie portrayed a flaky millennial women, it was as if the script writer played with the key identifiers of this generation both positive and negative. The movie touched on the positives, albeit briefly, namely that of a dissatisfaction with the world around them and a naked ambition to achieve their goals, however Julie threw the towel in as soon as the going got tough. Flitting from doctor training, mental health, photography and ending up in a bookstore. The movie then cleverly, and without any apparent judgement (this was left to the viewer) showed all the millennials negative traits, namely lazy, narcissistic and spoilt, the so called me-me-me generation, and believe me this character had it In spades!The movie had a light touch with no real overarching moralistic themes, we were merely observing this character as she progressed through her life. The acting was crisp from Renate Reinsve and she was never out of frame, I was convinced.In truth Julie was a most unattractive, self absorbed, self serving person and as the movie progressed you really didn't like her, by the end she hadn't really changed much, no revelatory epiphany here in my view, however it could be equally argued that embracing a single life and actually sticking at a photographic career may show some promise of maturity for the future. I found the end overly contrived and perfunctory. I think the editing left in too much of "ill" Aksel that added little to the story.I'm giving this a firm 6 outta 10, for holding my attention, recognising it is always difficult to judge the nuances of a subtitled movie.
ok The main character, Julie, became annoying in the first 5 minutes and stayed that way. Couldn't muster any empathy for her and as the film stayed with her closely the decent acting and cinematography couldn't engage me. One of those films where I was waiting for it to be over.
good "Julie is a lucky girl in the pink, no one berates her for hopping from one mÃ©tier to another, no external forces assault her sanity. After dabbling in medical practice, psychology, writing, and photography, she comfily settles down as an employee in a bookstore, and both Askel and Eivind love her. Inconceivably, there is not a single mean bone in those two innocuous boyfriends. Askel is candid with her right from the start, he is much older than her, more often than not, the generational gap will become their kryptonite down the line if they go steady. Later, he also accepts the bombshell of breakup without grudge, he is pulverized, but incredibly respectful to Julie's decision, which makes the breakup sex even steamier."read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.
bad I have to agree that the performances and direction in this film are excellent, and at times it's humorous and quite engrossing. But by the end of the film I just couldn't forgive the main character for her incredible selfishness. The final straw for me was when she made no attempt to be with the man who had really loved her while he was dying, and instead walked around all night staring up at his hospital room seemingly focused only on herself and her feelings. It's disturbing how many people reviewing this film on IMDB are finding ways to excuse this woman's narcissistic behavior in order to call this a great film, and I'm almost certain that if the main character had been male they would instead be denigrating him. It's rare for me to walk out of a film feeling depressed, but I certainly did in this case.
good I loved it. The best film I've watched in 2021. It's not easy to classify, it is part psychological drama, part comedy. The film is certainly not for everyone, and distributors advertising it as "comedy" do not help. Surely the more serious, pensive elements dominate comedic moments. The soundtrack plays a huge role, it's excellent and adds much to the experience. Actors do a very good job, especially the main actress and the actor playing her most important life partner (there's a few of them). It is expertly directed and edited. All in all a great movie, never boring though it deals with important life choices and the weighty question of what constitutes a good life and what makes a person good or bad. I plan to rewatch it.
good The new movie from Joachim Trier starring Renate Reinsve in an absolute star making turn tells the story of Julia in 12 chapters about her indecisiveness and her lack of empathy towards others and how she overcomes this.Renate Reinsve carries this movie as she embodies the character so well. The character Julia, is fascinating. At first glance she is likeable, incredibly charismatic and she just makes you fall in love with her. But as the movie goes on we get to know her dark side. She really cant take a strong decision which she will stick to, but rather jumps from one place to another, thereby hurting people that love her. So basically the movie is about the responsibility of growing up and having to take decisions knowing full well that these decisions affect people around you too.But the best thing about the movie, other than Renate's performance, is the atmosphere. It's as if you are in Oslo with those characters which we can attribute to the wonderful production and directing. Add to that there ae two surreal scenes which are probably the best cinematic moments of the year. One is where the world just stops and Julia spends a day with her new lover. The scene is so beautiful and so so sad too. The other scene is when Julia takes mushroom and has a trip where we get to know her character a lot (Similar to the dream scenes in Sopranos), her fears and insecurities. The imagery in that scene is truly magnificent and scary.But I don't think the movie is flawless. I think the director was afraid of the movie being labelled generic, that he tried too hard to subvert from it. (For example, the ironic use of narration) I thought it was unnecessary as the scenes were so genuine and so well made that it didn't matter it was explored before. I think the director should have just trusted the actors and the plot more and just made it as it is.In the end, I do think it is one of the best movies of the year, with probably the best performance of the year (along with KStew in Spencer) by Renate. Even if you aren't a fan of Romcoms, you will enjoy this as it is a wonderful character study of someone growing up and taking responsibility of her own life.
good The Worst Person in the World is Triers last film in his Oslo trilogy (Reprise, Oslo August 31th), and it's about a women named Julie (Reinsve) whom is struggling to find her place in the world.Virtue is the quality of being a good person and doing the right things, both for yourself and for others. I believe that Trier is problematizing this in this film by asking the question about whether or not you should do whats expected from the world around you, like settling for a more or less standardized life in forms of career and familiy, or if you should be out there and experiment to find your place in a rather confusing modern society.Julie is on her way into her thirties and is in a relationship with Aksel (Danielsen). She is an indecisive individual when it comes to what to make out of her life. Aksel, being in his mid forties, is ready to have a familiy of his own, but Julie is not ready for that just yet. Her search for an meaningful existence leads her to another man named Eivind (Norddrum), which she falls in love with. She leaves Aksel in hope for that this time, things will be different, but will it be so?This film is beautiful and intelligent. The way it depitcs todays social relations and culture in Norway, and probably other places in the world, is spot-on. All characters are deep and profound, where everyone of them playes an important role in the story no matter how big their part is on the screen. Everything seems to be in its right place.The Worst Person in the World is another great film by Joachim Trier.
ok The photo is the only interesting part of this movie, being about a woman who can never make up her mind about anything, something which affects everyone around her negatively. So the story is really boring. Even my girlfriend thought so, although this movie is supposed to "talk to" women.
ok 66/100To say that I had high expectations would be an understatement to the anticipation I truly felt for this film. A coming-of-age of a woman in her 30s sounded like that breath of fresh air that a character study needed. That must have been my warning that even if I tried my best, I wouldn't be able to connect with the film.Now, I'm not 30. In fact, I like to think that I'm too distant from that age and, although I was able to share many of the uncertainties that the protagonist experienced despite the age difference, if anything, those same concerns made me feel that my experiences could not be related to those of an older person who, perhaps, shares those same discomforts.The fact that the film doesn't prioritize those same themes doesn't help. There's a sub-plot that hints that the starkly contrasting and instantaneous decisions coming out of the protagonist would eventually lead to what she was running away from in the first place.It came out at a point where this very character needed something new to provide the audience. But it was only mentioned in an overly perfunctory way, leaving me wondering how it could've possibly tied to the film for his own benefit.At first, our protagonist feels the way she should've felt by the end of the film. Making her, well, not to my liking, at least not in the way that a movie called "The Worst Person in the World" would pretend. The same film that, above all, invites me to give it another chance in the future and, probably, by that point in my life, I will have a little more to say.
ok Well written and very well acted. Some scens do take a little too long for my liking. After a while you're like 'ok, we get it'. But apart from that, overall pretty great.7/10: very good, but not amazing.
bad I'm a sci-fi junkie and I can enjoy a stupid, mindless action flick. I still find Armageddon highly entertaining to this day. I'm the kind of person who loves these kinds of movies. Except when they're complete trash like this one.This movie is terrible and has almost no redeeming qualities. The only thing I mildly enjoyed was some cool-looking scenes of destruction. Even the space stuff, which is normally an automatic plus for me, added nothing. Maybe it's missing the feel of space that good directors like Christopher Nolan are able to capture. Or maybe it's because I didn't care about the story or the characters even a tiny bit.Speaking of characters... what characters? They're all cardboard cutouts. You have zero investment in any of them. They spew lines of atrocious dialogue that sound like they were written by a computer program.While watching this, I kept noticing different things copied from various movies. This is fine if the movie is well-made, or if the copying is just for a portion of the movie. But this movie is poorly-made, and the copying seems to make up the entire thing.And while each of the movies it stole from likely delved deep into that concept, this movie just throws it in there as an afterthought. There are so many useless side plots. These are things that could have worked if they narrowed it down and focused on a couple.This movie is really dumb. I kept trying to forgive the flaws and give it a chance, but less than halfway through I started laughing at the stupidity. I had to make sure I didn't laugh too loud in case someone was enjoying it somehow.Seriously, I can't emphasize how dumb this movie is. Throughout. And I don't just mean the science and lack of believability, I can get past that. But very simple things like, for example, when a character tells another, "You're the only one who believed me." And I think to myself, "Wait... WHAT??? He didn't believe you and had security escort you off the premises." The movie is jam-packed with this type of nonsense.In the end, if you can't, at the very least, deliver entertaining mayhem, then you have failed. (1 viewing, opening night 2/3/2022)
ok 6/10 - with the visuals of a true space blockbuster, this B movie features nonsensical dialogue, many many charcaters that serve absolutely no purpose, and an absolutely insane third act...but nonetheless, it's fun.
bad Another Emmerich mess. A Big budget wasted in a sloppy execution and a handful of stars acting by paycheck won't save a hollow script. I wonder how many professional or talented amateur writers found their work denied and how on Earth (or Moon if you like) scripts like this are produced. Rubbish! And I'm not insulting anyone, I'm just judging what I saw.
ok Roland Emmerich likes to have fun and blow up large stuff. With Moonfall, he blows up the Moon itself! Well, sort of. If you want this film to make sense, to show artistic qualities or make you ponder important questions about the nature and origin of humanity, you're in the wrong place. Instead, you have to imagine Emmerich as a little child who was given toys and who creates a completely bogus story that uses all of them together to maximum entertainment effect. That is it. You either laugh your behind off and enjoy the show or this movie is not for you.
ok Jesus this was bad! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I can't imagine what the hell halle berry etc thought when they first read the script. They must have died laughing.Worse than The Meg with at least 2 random mentions of China to ensure distribution rights.If you accept this is terrible, have a few drinks and watch it with friends at home - drink every time they say 'moon'. Do not pay money to see it though.
bad It's been quite some time since I've seen a cast full of talented, well-regarded actors all give performances that are this terrible. To be fair, given this dialogue, I don't think any actor could have pulled off a good performance.This screenplay was written by guys who have never talked to another human being before. Every line of dialogue is contrived and laughably on the nose, with exposition delivered in a way that sometimes makes Marvel's Eternals feel like a masterclass of writing.The story has enough logical holes to fit the moon through. Convenience piles on top of convenience to make catastrophe possible, and then to help the characters survive the catastrophe. It's a script that can't withstand even the slightest amount of logical thought.Moonfall makes just as little sense as 2012, and the characters are just as dull. But, in a way, this film is the more disappointing one because of how much better it could have been.The character introductions and the setup for the emotional conflicts that these characters are experiencing with each other are actually compelling and somewhat competent. But the writers do NOTHING with these conflicts once they're established. Nobody learns anything; nobody actually overcomes anything or changes at all.Not that a movie like this really needs masterful character development, but it at least needs something, ANYTHING to make us care and want these characters to succeed. But there's nothing.Not even the visual effects are particularly good; they're certainly not bad, but no improvements have been made since the 2009 release of 2012, which looked groundbreaking at the time.Still, I didn't hate watching this. I found myself mesmerised at how the filmmakers were literally dropping the ball every step of the way. If that sort of thing gives you enjoyment, then see this on the biggest screen that you can!
bad Watching the trailer, I stuck with Zendaya's MJ's rule; 'Expect disappointment so that you can never really be disappointed.' Except that this was beyond worse than what we had imagined.I like the idea of the film, that the moon is a threat to humanity. It's different but that's the only excellent thing to say about it. Other than that, it's a threat to our IQ.The biggest fault with Moonfall is that it fails to project the most basic principle to making a good disaster film which is creating a sense of fear for the audience. It almost doesn't have any, resulting in a boring entry. I did not get scared or restless, it didn't connect with me on a deeper level and it certainly doesn't have a good story to keep us at the edge of our seat hence, I couldn't care less if anyone dies. I didn't have the urgency to follow all the important people trying to put a stop from the catastrophic event because they throw all stakes out the window just like the Fast & Furious franchise. The main characters are ordinary people built extraordinarily strong.Adding the grim fact that Moonfall includes aliens composed of A. I and technology while also trying to relate to the audience by making it realistic, it falls down to the bottom of the abyss quickly. It doesn't work like other alien-based films like Prometheus or War of the Worlds did where they succeed in creating fear, showing people panicking while sucking us inside the experience.Yes, we are supposed to surrender from the sheer silliness of it but how can we when we are made to believe that its law of physics and world principles should follow ours and they broke every threshold to the point that we feel like this is a spin-off of the Transformers franchise.This marketed end-of-the-world disaster flick film is extremely ridiculous, even if you suspend your disbelief, you would never get your head around the plot. Not because you're dumb, but because the movie is, and I mean REALLY, REALLY dumb. It's like it's been written by Roland Emmerich's son and his dad helped him by putting scientific jargons to make it believable. Only if it did. ðŸ˜© And here I thought Independence Day 2: Resurgence was a trash, Moonfall is a shame to humanity's existence.Usually the end of the world presents seas of people running away, but Moonfall doesn't. It's a blockbuster movie about apocalypse and yet, it feels small at times. There even isn't that many shots that 'wow' us with horrific sceneries or powerful images like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow. Even the CGI isn't all that good especially when a person is talking mid-shot and the CGI looks awful in the background.Now don't get me started with the cheap comedy. I'm confused whether it's intended to make us annoyed or laugh cause I didn't laugh one bit and neither did the audience I was with.I know loving or hating a film is fully entitled to a person's taste and opinion but this movie is so bad, I dare to say this; if you like the film, you are an immature person and you have a bad taste.Okay, maybe some of you are asking me to calm down as you're reading this but imagine the hundreds or thousands of scripts just stacking there in the room, unread because it's written by a nobody or it's got some minor English errors. And they chose this to be greenlit amongst those??? It saddens me that the political game of the Hollywood industry has come to this. Emmerich was a great director but his ideas have now diluted less and less.Verdict: Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous film ever made, Moonfall steals the baton happily from its opponent. By far, the worst film of 2022.
bad 1 star dialogue. "you do know how to start a car right?" she says. And he replies, "I should warn you, I had my license revoked." Smirk.Lets have a mission launch date and time, and then tell everyone to go home before it kicks off. Then find a solution 3 minutes later and everyone is disappeared and not available.A bad mix of 2012, Armageddon, The Core and other b rated films. Then make it worse. Talk about the wrong stuff. This is just terrible in all aspects.More great dialogue. "You can't be serious." "We didn't come this far to fail."
ok So if you want to enjoy this movie ,disable your brain for a few hours,and let it all happen.If you do that,you might have a good 2 hours,like I did.Yes it's popcorn Sci-fi ,and sometimes it's good to watch movies like this. Special fx are awesome and it is spectacular. No ,it will never get Oscar for acting or original script or whatever. That's a deep - in this movie.But,..hey! I had fun. My score 6.7.
ok It may seem far too early in the year to be claiming such things but it's going to take something truly special (seriously random) for my personal favorite final scene of the year to be anything but Moonfall's need to be seen effort.Without dwelling on that for any longer or entering in spoiler territory overload, it's onto the important matter at hand of exploring Roland Emmerich's latest city/landmark destroying blockbuster.To describe Moonfall as ludicrous, preposterous and utterly bonkers would be underselling just how out there Emmerich's big, dumb and even sometimes fun new film is, as while you may be expecting a typical astronauts and the government save the world from a hurtling towards the Earth Moon type of film, Moonfall goes to many an unexpected place that must surely make it a genuine contender for what will be one of 2022's most bizarre blockbusters.A director who has well and truly given up being anything his not, Emmerich's latest effort is very much cut from the same cloth as his most renowned blockbusters such as Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 and for anyone expecting any type of nuance to be present in Moonfall you're heading for a rude shock, as the films daft script, B-grade worthy performances and pointless/ridiculous plot points and characters litter almost every scene of the films two hour plus runtime.Thankfully it appears as though Emmerich and his cast that includes the paycheck collecting duo of Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson as NASA employees Jocinda Fowl and Brian Harper, Game of Thrones John Bradley as wannabe doctor and mathematician wizz KC Houseman and a few why even bother appearances from Michael Pena and Donald Sutherland all were on the same page with Moonfall's insane premise, meaning that there is fun to be had from watching Catwoman, Ed Warren and Samwell Tarley head to the moon to save humankind, especially as the films unexpected late acts take hold.If you as a viewer fail to get on the same wavelength as the film from the early stages its likely Emmerich's unrefined, loud and CGI infested event will quickly become a film that is hard too sit through, as there's little reason to recommend this film in such a content heavy time for films of all shapes and sizes but there's an argument to be made that these type of daft but knowingly so films have a time and place in our marketplace, despite there being no reason for it to exist outside of mindless entertainment.Final Say -One of Roland Emmerich's most out there carnage-filled blockbusters yet full of cringe and head scratching moments, Moonfall is even more crazy than one might've expected but provides the exact type of experience one would expect from a filmmaker that has long since passed the time where he tried to be anything that his not.2 Fuzz Aldrin's out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
ok If you watch a disaster movie made by Roland Emmerich you get what you expect: big explosions, fine work by the special departments and a rather simple story with forgettable characters. Moonfall is no exception - get your coke and pop-corn, lay back and enjoy the show. But in the case you don't like that kind of big screen disaster movies, don't bother.
bad This film is feels like a parody of other Roland Emmerich. It honestly feels like Roland Emmerich saw F9 (2021) & he made this film just to say, You people think that F9 was a stupid film, you thought that was stupid crap, well guess what I'm going to make something even more stupid." This was 2-hours of stupidity that I chose to fast forward a lo t of the film just to shorter my suffering. Overall, Moonfall (2022) is an abysmal film & it's easily Roland Emmerich's 2nd worst film behind Godzilla (1998).
ok Being a Millennial, I can attest to our generation that it was a great time to be alive with "Independence Day" and "Godzilla" being some of our favorite tween-age blow-up-knock-down action movies to go see with our friends in the theater 3 times in the same day, with campy yet lovable characters like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Those were the days. I still enjoy watching those flicks from time to time - not just for the nostalgia. They are still quite entertaining in their own right.Now we have "Moonfall" some 25 years later. Cut from the same construction paper, but more like pieces of old scripts from Roland Emmerich's late '90s writing room shredder taped together in hopes the characters and dialog would be usable in telling the grandiose destructo-type story instead of just talking props. Speaking of which, I give props to Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley (who actually had a solid character to go with his style) for trying, but it simply wasn't enough.I've listened to commentaries and interviews with Emmerich and I personally think he doesn't have good instincts on how to put a balanced action film together since the mid 2000s (with the ID4 sequel, if you watch the deleted scenes cut what would've been the best and most meaningful scenes of the entire movie) with the aim of just going big and loud, using any means whatsoever. It works...until it doesn't. Action fatigue sets in frequently in this and many of his recent past movies. It's alarming when I am physically incapable of caring less about the world ending than watching these characters attempt to get from beginning to end - in fact, there was no palpable peril despite the entire earth getting properly f'ed up, we only see it in overhead shots of floods and earthquakes and meteorites (I think COVID may have had something to do with not being able to have scenes with dozens of extras on the ground clamoring over each other like in all other action flicks from the days of yore).However, the concept was intriguing and in my opinion, pretty great. It reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's "Rendezvous with Rama" but with the Moon instead of a floating cylinder in space. I really did enjoy watching the last 20-30 mins or so play out after an hour and a half of random skipping around characters trying to hatch the plan to get us to that point while trying to make the audience like and/or care. If the script had half the heart and good campiness of something like "Independence Day", it definitely could have kicked my rating up a little.Wait for streaming.
bad I really can't express how much I hated this film. I went in with my brain turned off, expecting a dumb fun disaster film with some crazy fun set pieces. Instead the first hour was a dour slog with uninteresting characters, while the second half was utterly insane (in a bad way).The film's premise is simple. The moon is falling, can Earth surivive? But instead the film decides is going to try to offer a cerebral and complex backstory to the moon for some reason. In a 10 minute exposition dumb, Patrick Wilson learns that humans actually originated from a halo ring, but then ai rose up and took over nanoparticles to kill humans, so the humans made 1000 moons and flew them to different parts of the galaxy??? What?This plot twist is so dumb, immediatley after it happens, Wilson has to re-explain what he just learned to the other characters (and the audience who is clearly baffled).Meanwhile, there's a super dull survival plot on Earth with characters you don't care about. There's one mildly entertaining car chase which lasts 2 minutes tops.I can't describe how bad this film is. The only thing I liked were the cool cgi shots of the moon plummeting to earth and the asteroids.AVOID.
ok Emmerich - who you gonna hire when it comes to a movie of this kind and calibre? I mean one is almost tempted to say that he is doing one thing in different forms/movies. There are elements from so many other movies here. Be it in the characters or the themes of the movie. The important question though is: can you suspend your disbelief? And I don't mean just a little! I am talking about all the way here.And if you've done that, all the cliches come out and they will make you cringe. The characters feel like they have a story put upon them. You'll either find certain things gullible or plain offensive to your taste buds. The special effects are top notch, the dialog not so much. Many moments that feel ... lame quite frankly. The whole patriotism thing is to be expected - but that doesn't make it any better either. Michael Pena feels underused - I don't hate him - which may be just enough I reckon (pun intended).Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are the ones that save the day (no pun intended). John Bradley may be the wild card - but he also is hit and miss. His character that is, he is trying his best I'd say. Just never critisize the conspiracy guy from Godzilla versus Kong ever again, if you actually love this character right here.Nothing more to say here other than it is quite rich, that Emmerich critisizes Star Wars and the MCU when he is unable to make a coherent Blockbuster of his own, that at times make Fast and Furious look like it's legit and realistic ... I know, right? But as you can see in my rating, I didn't mind too much ... or rather I'm being "kind" again - something I have been accused of a lot anyway.
bad Or give him a screenwriter. This is absolutely the biggest piece of trash yet. Extremely poor writing filled with cliches, trite comments, expected plots and the comic second banana. And the plot???? Gawd!!!!! The moon is hollow???? I spent part of the time. They've resusitated the characters for 2012 and INDEPENDENCE DAY and given them a new plot twist. It was so bad, I almost left halfway thru, (and I got in for free), but I decided to stay because I wanted to match the currect characters with those in the other films. Wait til it shows up on tv in 4 weeks and then for $5.99 groan with the friends and family. This is a stinker - 3 stars is generous!
bad Entertaining plot concept but either far too serious and too slow with not enough crazy or exciting moments or far too preposterous to be taken seriously. The special effects are sometimes spectacular but nothing new, the plot has major issues and the pacing is awful as it jumps back and forth between the different groups. The leads are ok, but the supporting character are poorly written and acted and the few jokes weren't funny.
bad What was this moronical madness? Lost in space? Et? Cocoon? NO! As they were all worth watching. However this mess is not. The acting is dead, a complete mismatch of actors and the storyline is beyond a joke. Then the same old USA saves the world via Hollywood but normaly with a good script, actors and possibly even a soundtrack, yet this farce missed all of them. And on that note it's a 1 and that's being so kind ..
ok Of course, those who are not picky will love it.But Roland Emmerich , previously with Dean Devlin and now solo, has always been a futile and superficial director in the treatment of these scripts. And it's a shame, because they are great plots, but they lack talent and brains in charge. And while the catastrophe genre is appealing and Emmerich likes to involve in it , he's like the party entertainer with jokes that only he laughs at.Looking at his resume, you can see that he has great intentions that he doesn't know how to develop. For those who remember, 2012 (Geez!), The Day After Tomorrow, 1998's Godzilla, Independence Day and even The Patriot are good examples of this. You watch it, enjoy it, but when it ends, you get that impression of "it could have been better" or "this premise promised much more". It's always the same thing.When I saw his name linked to the production, I was already thinking "Hey! Here comes bland food...".Verdict: weak. It gets a 5.0, just for some special effects. But the nonsense development of the plot and the mediocre solutions destroy the film's progress.
bad Cannot be a worse movie out right now. I tried three times to watch and finish the film. Couldn't do it - don't waste your time or money. I BOUGHT this movie to see it early. HUGE lapse in judgement on my part. It's simply unbearably bad. Not bad like the 1960s classic sci-fi films that were bad in a funny way. Just plain bad bad. ðŸ˜‘ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ’£
ok In 2011, astronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) is able to save a space shuttle mission from an alien swarm. Back on earth, he is betrayed by fellow astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) and gets blamed for human error. It's ten years later. Brian is a shell of himself. Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon's orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.Director Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I'm willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It's his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It's the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He's not making the big budget action thriller hits.
ok Sadly, this thing stinks. Your guess is as good as mine as to what is going on. Something about the moon being built by ancient aliens, who happen to be our very distant relatives. An a.i. Monster lives inside with bad intentions. I think that's it. Halle berry is miscast and i'm still waiting for michael pena to become a movie star. This turkey won't help. It looks expensive, though. Whether they get back the 140 mil budget looks doubtful.
ok Moonfall is a very frustrating and boring watch.It joins a long list of movies where a passable premise is tortured to death by the injection of dubious sci-fi, tired cliches, and uninteresting characters.Despite the best efforts of Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley who each put in decent performances, the weak script could not be salvaged.The plot was bogged down by unnecessary human drama (two divorced adults and a joyriding teen are flung at us early doors), with none of this drama particularly compelling. The elements of the plot that were focused on the moon and the disaster element were better, but became increasingly messy and uninspired.A lot of the CGI was surprisingly bad for a big budget blockbuster. Some elements were quite cool, such as the shots of the giant moon looming over the horizon, but the rest was underwhelming.At only 2 hours long though, Moonfall thankfully doesn't become too self indulgent. It's a shame as I think there was a better film to be had here given the original premise. At the very least this film should have been a fun ride, but that wasn't the case.One to miss unfortunately.
bad Geez louise. I can't even tell you how awful this movie is. I like silly sci fi like the best of them but this was just down right stupid. It was so awful I didn't even think it was fun. This movie is disjointed with poor writing and poor acting. You would think it would be better than this considering these actors. I didn't care one bit for these characters and kept thinking the moon needs to crash and burn and put them out of their misery. Not even a good pop corn flick like many other silly sci fi movies ie, Armageddon, Deep Impact, Geo storm.......no this ignorant movie couldn't even come up to the level of those stilly movies were...Awful, awful movie. One of the worst I have seen for a while....
ok Greetings from Lithuania.If you are on a boring weekend, and it happens that you have a few free hours to waste, some light alcohol nearby and something to eat and you are looking for a movie like "Interstellar", " 2001 Space Odyssey", "Spaceballs" and "Armageddon" (wait what??) - look no were else - "Moonfall" (2022) is a mix of all those movies and with some flavor of Star Wars. I kid you not. And don't forget to turn your brain off."Moonfall" is a latest disaster sci=fi movie from Roland Emmerich and if you have seen any of his movies before, you know what you will get here. I got exactly what i wanted to - a mindless yet actually solidly made nonsense that was well paced and directed - at running time 2 h i wasn't bored and as a huge science fiction fan i was mindlessly entertained. Special effects were pretty good as well as the overall experience.Overall, "Moonfall" is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Its a movie were you have turn the logic of and just enjoy the ride. If enjoyed at least some of the previous movie of Roland Emmerich then "Moonfall" might actually be pretty nice escapism for a boring evening.
bad Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: "The action was gibberish." You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be "a good guy," but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?
ok Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who MÃ¶bius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that MÃ¶bius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, MÃ¶bius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while.
ok Weird and confusing camerawork, un relatable characters, soulless and generic.Sony needs to pay more attention at their SpiderVerse or give up the rights to Disney.One of the worst CBM in the last years.
ok Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.
ok "Morbius" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that "Morbius" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.
bad I collected comics, specifically Marvel/Spider-Man. Spidey was my favorite and this character, Morbius, was one of my favorite to battle Spider-Man. This aside, I won't bother presenting my detailed autopsy of this travesty. I will say that they strayed too far from the original story and made things convoluted. Why couldn't they just keep it simple. Instead they went off the rails with a ridiculous script. They took a rich and vibrant comic story and took a giant dump on it.
bad This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.
bad Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, "it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10.
ok 6/10 - I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didn't love the visual design of the vampires, I thought the cinematography, VFX, sound design, and Adria Arjona (who is now on my "Actors to Watch" list) really elevated the relatively weak story.
good Michael Morbius(Jared Leto) a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease, struggles to find a cure, when he thinks he has, but things work a little too well, until he discovers there's more supernatural to it, then he could have imagined.It was entertaining, but to much feels taken out, like it was supposed to be R rated, but they decided at the last minute decided to take out most of the violence in order to get a PG 13. Everybody plays there roles pretty well. Jared Leto does alright has Morbius, but the film itself is pretty cliched, but still fun and entertaining, and if that is all you want then Morbius does deliver.
ok Well movie start with a good note and it keeps you gripping throughout the time. Action sequences are mind-blowing specially the vfx are actually very better. Jared Leto was so perfect in Morbius role as well as the other cast perfoms well. Story was simple not that great but it gives you a different vibe as compare to other sci-fi films. It's a one-time watch if you like sci-fi superhero films.You can definitely enjoy once....
ok This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home, this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat. I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time. It's a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it. I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles. I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then you'll have fun with this.
bad Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
ok Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.
ok 3.5 out of 5 stars.Morbius is a pretty fair superhero film that may be thin on plot and decent action sequences. It does add an entertaining adaptation bringing in another character that is supposedly a Spider man villain. May not be as fun as the Venom movies. Jared Leto does a great job playing a sick Dr. Michael Morbius. Who is on a desperate search for a cure from his blood borne illness. Which one will be leading him into becoming a vampire. Adria Arjona also did great playing his love interest. Matt Smith is a bit flat with his character and also playing a villain that is one dimensional and forgettable. Jared Harris playing as Morbius mentor is also thin with his character. Along with Tyrese Gibson which the script did not give these characters anything more besides be on the hunt for Morbius.The film is very fast paced. And the script does not give much character development with any of the supporting characters besides Michael and Martine (Adria Arjona). The plot is thin and may not be as strong. The action sequences were okay. With the fast movements with the characters and editing which makes the scenes more of a chore to see than increase the entertainment value.If your looking for a quick superhero escapism in the theatres this film will be great. The direction did not do anything new to make it stand out compared to any other superhero films. There is a mid credit scene to give you a hint on where this character will be placed in the universe. The film is not great but still delivers some entertainment.
good There are many Marvel Legends. But none are quite as striking and engaging as Morbius. Jared Leto brings this fierce character to life and shows he has more layers than any character from Copshop.There was a certain scene involving Morbius' bat powers that made the audience cheer harder than seeing Channing Tatum's leech-covered behind in Lost City of D.An iconic moment is Morbius saying 'I am Venom'. This is funny because you think he's venom. Then he says 'only joking dr micheal morbius at your service'. This is clever because is not venom but rather morbius, so he made a reference to venom in a subtle way and then he reminds the audience who he actually is.Matt Smith was baddie smith and was a mega wowow lil scrappy instanity elden lord ultra uber hitman bodyguard mega core scrap lord.Morbius is a baddie and a half. This marvel legend keeps me up at night with how epic he is, i can't sleep thinking of any scene jared leto is in.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, "Mad Men").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as "The Living Vampire", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.
bad No surprises this was awful. Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying. CGI was laughingly bad and the slow-mo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable. Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue. There's little fun and it took itself way too seriously. Honestly, this made Venom seem alright in comparison.2/10.
ok FIRST OFF: I scrolled down through some of these reviews, I understand, and agree with some of the criticisms I see about this film, others.. well I can just see you really want Spidey & Company back at Marvel & I do believe it does help cloud the judgement just a bit & I get it, now am I saying this movie is perfect? NO. Is it good? Well, no. But it's okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.Morbius is a cool little movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I, being a comic reader for most of my life wasn't jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it at least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films' story does what it can with what very little it has to work with, it's not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through it's basic dialogue, and story errors to see great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY mention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really cool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there seeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your head or ask yourself if you missed something & I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have been left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which I really hope didn't happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a blockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely should've been rated R, no question about it, and it probably would've hit better, but then again the budget cut would've probably gave us worse looking CGI.At the end of the day, check it out if you're thinking about it, if you're on the fence, just don't.The real lesson is... Film Studios.
ok Underwhelmed as I left the theater, I thought maybe I missed something but my trip here to the review pages confirms my opinion. Forgetting about the Morbius character's ties to the Marvel Comic Book franchise, this is basically a run of the mill vampire flick, and unfortunately, it doesn't break any new ground for the genre. The story is somewhat ordinary, as Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) seeks a cure for a rare blood disease, and by experimenting with bats, manages to turn himself into a creature of the night. His childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who helped fund the research for a cure, self infects with the same serum and discovers a lust for power that comes with the transformation. It's a pretty tepid plot line that results in some head scratching CGI considering how far special effects have evolved to the present day. More effective is the virtually seamless facial metamorphosis from human to vampire and back again, but it's something you expect nowadays and not particularly innovative. It all brings into question why the filmmakers would go for such a tired and formulaic approach for a vampire super-hero. When all is said and done, you can't even say that Morbius came out of the picture as a good guy, as his options didn't suggest much more than defeating Milo's alter-ego in a final vampiric showdown.
ok This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics have rated it. It's nothing amazing but it's not horrible either. Storyline was very predictable but far better then most cheesy crap that comes out. I'd give it a 6.5 nothing amazing but slightly better then average.
ok I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching "Morbius" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 "Suicide Squad", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie "Requiem for a Dream". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then "Morbius" doesn't disappoint.All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie "Morbius", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars.
good Morbius is not a perfect movie but it's a fun and entertaining ride. It's a comic book movie and yes, it won't win an Oscar or other awards. But it's still not that bad how some people make it seem it is.Definitely worth watching and seeing it for yourself before being scared off by reviews that are not even slightly accurate.Just my opinion :)
ok I'm not sure why there is so much hate. It's definitely a darker Marvel movie. Everyone did a good job in it and I think the two leads were well cast. There were a few plot holes but the graphics and camera angles were awesome. It was a good origin story.
ok Someone on BBC1 asked Jared Leto about this, but I had it in mind before. And I think the Bat Man joke is too obvious to be missed out on. And that he is being played by a guy who also portrayed the Joker.That aside, I can see that some people don't like the movie. The CGI isn't that good - especially considering the budget this must have had. There is also a dance (by the main villain) that reminds us of the bad dance by Tobey Maguire in Spiderman 3 ... also as cringeworthy as the one from back then. We then also get a Kayser Soze moment. Well not as iconic as the one from the Usual Suspects ... but it still is there.We have a lot of scary faces, but not a lot of blood. Considering the violence and the death that are occuring ... this does not display them as visual as it could. But if it did, this wouldn't have gotten a PG-13 now would it? While this is a Marvel character, it is owned by Sony .. but as you may be aware there are other things that seem to get .. into the mix. One of them has an appearance during the credits ... in two scenes. No scene after the credits .. but those two scenes suggest something that Jared Leto has already hinted at himself ... an new Universe is building ... well if the powers to be and the box office allows them to.Not a bad movie overall, but lacking a few things, even though the actors and the cinematography are not to be blamed (the latter has some bad moments especially during the last fight, where I couldn't tell where up and down was) ... sound was amazing, but I watched it in an Atmos cinema, so there's that. Very flawed but not as bad as some probably think it is ... it is an origin story and is quite stale pace wise ... but it is what it is.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Discotheques and Night Clubs were regularly referred to as 'meat markets', and all movie lovers are familiar with the term 'meet-cute'. It's rare for meat and meet to merge into a cautionary tale of modern-day dating, but that's what we get from director Mimi Cave's first feature film and a script from Lauryn Kahn (IBIZA, 2018). This twisted film should slide easily into the Midnight Movie rotation for those looking for a slicer, rather than a slasher.Daisy Edgar-Jones ("Normal People", 2020) stars as Noa, a twenty-something frustrated with the results of digital dating apps. Her experience is a case study on the challenges of meeting someone special, or even someone not psychotic, through a dating app. She swipes right on a cute puppy picture, and almost immediately receives an unwanted 'private' shot. When she does agree to have dinner with one guy, he criticizes her fashion, yearns for old-fashioned femininity, makes her pay half, and doesn't bother to hold the door for her. Noa tells her close friend Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) that she's done with dating for a while, and who can blame her?Not long after that trainwreck date, and when she's least expecting it, Noa gets her meet-cute in the produce aisle at the grocery store. Steve (Sebastian Stan who plays Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Universe) is a charming, good-looking guy and she agrees to give him her number. Their first date is filled with the usual background Q&A stuff, but it's clear that Noa and Steve have some chemistry. The reason this works cinematically is that director Cave allows us to view Steve through Noa's eyes. Just like her, we are diligently searching for red flags, remaining on high alert for signs something is off. But plastic surgeon Steve's early warning signs only become noticeable much later (too late) after his true self is revealed.Steve's true-self-revelation is a doozy, and the opening credits pop up just after the gut-punch, approximately 40 minutes in. While the first act plays a bit like a traditional rom-com with all the associated romantic awkwardness, the stunningly plausible shift jerks us and Noa in a different direction. Additional supporting work is provided by Dayo Okeniyi as an initially helpful bartender whose recognition of horror film tropes prevent him from taking any heroic action, and Charlotte Le Bon as a surprise addition to the proceedings. But it's the performances and the twisted chemistry of Ms. Edgar-Jones and Mr. Stan that allows the premise to work and Act 3 to not quite slip into full blown absurdity. Without giving anything else away, I can admit that this referendum on dating and people, presented as a horror film, struck me as a blend of PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020), GET OUT (2017), and a personal favorite, EATING RAOUL (1982).Streaming exclusively on HULU beginning March 4, 2022.
ok I must admit that I was initially intrigued by the synopsis for this 2022 thriller titled "Fresh" from writer Lauryn Kahn and director Mimi Cave. However, I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. But with it being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a viewing.And while the concept idea behind "Fresh" certainly was interesting or fresh, pardon the pun, then it was a movie that was oddly bland and generic. Sure, there were aspects to the storyline that had weight and leverage to it, but overall, then the movie was just lacking spice, pardon the pun.Sure, it was a fun jab at today's meat market with the dating apps and services, I get that, but at the same time the movie was just a bit too generic and predictable."Fresh" has a relatively small cast ensemble, but I will say that the actors and actresses in the movie definitely rose to the occasion and carried the movie quite well. It was just a shame that they had so little to work with in terms of a properly entertaining and enjoyable script. I was not familiar with the cast that performed in the movie, so that was something that I enjoyed at least.Visually then "Fresh" was adequate. It is not a gory movie, as director Mimi Cave doesn't delve into the full-blown gore and macabre. Most of the gruesome things are left to the imagination, for better or worse.I found "Fresh" to be suitable for a single viewing, but that was about it. This is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just simply doesn't have the ingredients to support more than a single serving, pardon the pun.My rating of "Fresh" lands on a very bland five out of ten stars.
ok First of all, there is not a single minute of this movie that would classify it as a comedy. It is a dark and disturbing suspense/horror movie.I'm not a horror fan, but I liked this one. I had an uneasy feeling throughout the majority of it (you'll see why). The acting was better than most films of this type.
good 8/10 - Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastian Stan, and Jojo T. Gibbs all turn in solid performances in this unique, wonderfully weird, slightly repulsive, and entrancing horror comedy (with a fantastic payoff) that is perfect for fans of fellow Searchlight release, Ready or Not.
good Fresh (2022) is a movie I recently watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a single lady a little desperate to find a half decent date. She finds a nice guy and they date for several weeks and then he pops the big question, "would you like to take a cabin trip?" She's excited and goes changing her life forever...This movie is directed by Mimi Cave in her directorial debut and stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (War of the Worlds), Sebastian Stan (Captain America: Winter Soldier), Jojo T. Gibbs (Twenties), Dayo Okeniyi (See) and Andrea Bang (Luce).The storyline for this is very well paced and delivered. I really liked the plot, characters and how the circumstances unfold. There is really good dialogue and chemistry between the characters and intensity in the circumstances. The horror elements are subtle and while I watched the film unfold I was a bit disappointed there wasn't much gore, especially with this premise; however, the ending is so strong and well done it makes up for it.Overall this is a fantastic "new" addition to the horror genre at a time horror fans are starved for something new and original. I would score this an 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend it.
ok Fresh depicts the horrors of modern dating seen through one young woman's defiant battle to survive her new boyfriend's unusual appetites. This movie goes pretty off the rails and for good reason. Writer Lauryn Kahn is no stranger to rom-coms having several flops in the past. For this feature, she toys around with the horror genre to give a unique perspective both taken literally and metaphorically. The first 30-minutes are setup like a pleasing romantic movie. I quite enjoyed that beginning. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan have a cute relationship and great chemistry, which lasts throughout. After that first half hour, the movie starts to pick up and show a darker side. In fact, the opening credits don't happen until then. What comes next is absurd and chilling. Without Mimi Cave's direction, her feature debut fun fact, I doubt the movie would work. She makes this both an uncomfortable and entertaining watch all together. Her techniques may not all be foreign to the horror genre and it definitely can be predictable at times, yet I feel she pulls it off.I mentioned our two leads before, and they get even better as the movie progresses. Edgar-Jones gives a fully committed performance proving once again she's a great newcomer within the past few years. I really liked her character and how she's able to pull of a good performance to please others in the most desperate of times. Sebastian Stan does well in this role and is completely mesmerizing. Once this hits Hulu in March, there are going to be a few meme-able moments with him and quite the talk surrounding his character. Another good performance comes from Jojo T. Gibb's as the friend trying to piece this mystery together. There's a couple characters that make their entrance but feel like they serve no purpose once they get their time to shine. In the climax, I expected more from them but their works are easily resolved. And the movie ends abruptly if you ask me. As a whole, the runtime is close to two hours. It overstays its welcome with scenes that go nowhere and a few missing pieces never to return to. As much as I liked the beginning, I feel as if that could've been chopped down some even though the half hour mark throws you in for a loop. Not everything is entirely new and it could be better, but the performances and Mimi Cave's work pulls it together. This will for sure gain a cult following in the future and connect with some in such a way. I can't say it all worked for me, it's a bit messy and too long, but still a solid watch.
ok Firstly imagine how much money Steve would have made off of Sheila from Santa Clarita diet. Fresh is not what I expected, it's not a comedy and even though it's quite gory I can't call it a horror either but that's the nearest genre you could give it. It's not there to scare you out your couch or sleep; maybe out of your dating life but that's about it. It's a romance gone wrong. I like how it combines two of my favorite genres because I'm a sucker for lovey dovey movies but then it takes a turn. The first part of the movie is quite normal, girl with an inauspicious dating life to say the least, meets a seemingly nice guy and they hit off. A meet-cute I believe it's called. The opening credits roll in after 30min as if to signal the end to that and start of something else. A 30min intro.I guess it's the hopeless romantic side of me that led me to believe for a split second this was going to turn into a romcom, then it didn't and I thought oh so he's gonna end up being the molesting type, and it took another, even worse turn. All my premeditations just kept getting crossed out for something worse so I just stopped assuming. My assumptions were actually going to be easier to stomach than how it actually turned out. And how he thought he could get Noa to see things his way too, I guess that's how he met his wife Ann so he probably thought he could pull it off.It's really quite a shocking and decent film, in an unsettling way and I liked it. It's not gory enough to put off an average viewer; it somehow sits on the edge where both a horror fan and non-fan could enjoy the movie. I think they should be a genre for movies like this one, like "Promising Young Woman", or "the invisible man" which I did love but didn't find it frightening enough to call a horror. And this definitely isn't a comedy, I don't know why it's described as such. It's uncomfortable to watch yet entertaining at the same time because it doesn't let itself become unwatchable which it easily could have been and I think that's exquisite directing.
ok This film presents itself as a basic romantic comedy that deteriorates into a dark comedic thriller. What could have been an intriguing horror, however, sadly proves to be just as basic as the premise it begins with. Although the cast does well with what they are given, the most interesting characters are not fully illustrated, creating a missed opportunity to study the characters and their mindsets. This film attempts to be an homage to psychological horror films but lacks the screen presence and insightful characters to do so. The tone is inconsistent, with serious issues being portrayed horrifyingly real while having the killer be over-the-top in his execution. The cinematography while at times spectacular also has a basic look to it that makes the film feel cheap and generic. The film also recycles plot elements of better-executed films, making this one feel lost in the mix. By no means is this an abomination to cinema, but because of its generic characteristics, lacks the elements to feel memorable, creating an overall missed opportunity of an intriguing concept.
ok Just as she tires of the dating scene, a woman meets her ideal man ... but he only wants her for her body.Latest episode in the Canadian (and French) obsession with body horror. It's an aesthetic that doesn't happen to appeal to me - each to his own - but when it manages to reveal something about life I'm all ... pierced ears.This opens as a well written rom-com, with a long prologue nicely observing a bad date and the gallows-humour shared by veterans of the dating-trenches. Then it all goes wrong as we plunge in to the psycho-captivity of a serial killer, which leads to a pretty bland sequence of events.The production is stylish, performances good, and the music interesting - sometimes ironic or humorous. A big problem is that the action in the climax is handled ineptly as the actors flounce about to little purpose. But the biggest problem is that it's all one long platitude: through no fault of their own, women are badly treated by men and are entitled to stick up for themselves. And it takes 114 mins to tell us what we knew all along. To make things worse, there's only a vague insight into the killer and the people around him (one of whom appears and disappears without explanation), so the scenario just presents as a flat revenge fantasy. The most intriguing character is the killer's wife, but the reason for her role in the cruelty passes by without a thought.Watch Eat (2014) instead, a genuine body horror with something to say about craziness.
good If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)"FRESH is an unforgettably shocking start to another Sundance Film Festival, holding all of the characteristics to end up as one of the absolute favorites.Mimi Cave delivers an extraordinarily captivating, assertive directorial debut, taking Lauryn Kahn's original, gruesome screenplay to the next level. Sebastian Stan demonstrates his ludicrous range, while Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a breakthrough performance that may warrant a couple of awards by the end of the festival.With an extremely engaging yet too quick first act, the viewers are immediately grabbed by the endearing love story that slowly builds up to a brutally impactful revelation, leading the movie into a rabbit hole of (in)tense, suspenseful, surprising developments.The last twenty minutes are the definition of insanity."Rating: A-
ok Daisy Edgar-Jones of "Normal People" fame and Sebastian Stan currently portraying Tommy Lee in "Pam & Tommy" have cemented themselves as favorites in my book, so just seeing their names attached to this project turns this into a must-see. Furthermore, the premise description and trailer are respectful enough not to give out spoilers, and instead the movie actually goes out of its way to keep the mystery until about 50 minutes into the story. When it gets going though, it's all silly, full of contrived moments. However, the one specific revenge act is quite satisfying to watch, I must admit. Overall this is a mixed bag, which you can actually follow along by just having it playing in the background while doing something else.
good As "Fresh" (2022 release; 115 min.) opens, we got to know Noa, a twenty-something woman who is not having much luck on the dating scene. Then one night she gets to know a guy while at the grocery store. They hit it off, and before we know it, they are off on a weekend vacation...Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of director Mimi Cave. Equally important, this is written by Lauryn Kahn ("Ibiza"). The way the movie is described by IMDb is utterly and completely misleading. This movie is not about "the horrors of modern dating". This is an outright scary movie, and a startling and disturbing one at that. I had no inkling whatsoever what was about to unfold. The movie is plot heavy so I really can't say much more about that. Even though the movie is unsettling, I will also say that this is one of the better movies I have seen so far this year. The two lead performances from Sebastian Stan (whom we saw most recently in "Pam & Tommy"), and British up-and-coming actress Daisy Edgar-Jones, are tops. Kudos must go to both Lauryn Kahn (for coming up with this idea) and Mimi Cave (for implementing into onto the screen). As a complete aside, I recently saw "Drive My Car", where the opening credits started rolling 40 min into the movie, something I cannot recall having ever seen before. Well, guess what: the opening credits for "Fresh" start rolling only about 35 min into it!"Fresh" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival, and not even two months later, it started streaming on Hulu. If you are in the mood for a scary movie that is at times disturbing and unsettling, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.
ok This movie is just not good but also not bad. It's in the limbo of mixture of good and bad movies. It's just something... I need more characters for my review so I'm just typing to post this.
ok What the hell happened to movies where stuff like this is critically acclaimed?Flat, bad acting. Sebastian Stan is hamming it up, and he's the only decent part of this movie.Awful dialogue and script. For some reason, the screenwriter seems to be half-black, but she wrote every black person like a goddamn stereotype out of 90s RomCom. Such a predictable and generic script that felt like it was written by an AI.Also some decent shots in this movie but overall the movie was very poorly lit and the digital cinematography was flat and ugly. Is it really that hard to shoot on actual film? This director knows her way around a camera but she really does not know how to light a scene (especially at night). Also, this will most likely be some of the worst editing I'll see all year for a movie, I understand what they're going for, but it's incredibly ineffective and distractingI get that this is an "important" film but let's not kid ourselves and act like it's a good movie. 4/10.
good It loses its momentum a few times due to one too many subplots but Fresh is an incredibly unique film that balances its extreme tonal shift skillfully, resulting in something equal parts darkly comedic and truly disturbing.Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a superb lead performance with a character that's easy to empathize and root for. She also has great natural chemistry with Sebastian Stan, who is phenomenal in a role that goes completely against his usual type.Mimi Cave's direction is excellent, super stylish and inventive. The soundtrack is amazing, full of songs so ironic for their corresponding scenes it's perfect. The music by Alex Sommers is also great, effectively haunting yet beautiful.
ok Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) are single best friends in the city. Noa is getting tired after another bad date. When she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan), she decides to give it one more shot but that's a mistake.It's a bit slow at the start. The bad date is more cliche than funny. It takes thirty minutes to get to the opening credits. This needs to get to the point a bit faster. Through it all, I do love the doey-eyed acting of Daisy Edgar-Jones. Sebatian Stan does well playing both ends of the spectrum. I would like for the girls to finish him off sooner but they never do in this type of movies. It's a fine midnight madness movie but it could have pushed harder.
ok Quite the wild ride but not necessarily the ride you might expect. The first half hour, before the titles (!), promises a romcom as good or better than the A-list Hollywood stuff. Then we abruptly segue into a horror/tortureporn story without any real warning. The only really scary thing here is the realization that the producers of the film are not treating cannibalism simply as a mental illness, like HANNIBAL for eg, they are in fact glorifying it. THAT should keep you up at night! By Act III it is clear the budget and the creativity ran out at the same time, and suddenly all you are watching is a bad indie with nowhere to hide.
ok One of the biggest disappointments of this beginning of year. The premise is good, the film is stylish, there is some cool editing here and there, some references are funny and it tries to say something (predatory relationships, how men treat women, current dating culture).However, this feels like fake. A film created by privileged people for priviliged people, trying really hard to check all the boxes. It has his audience, that audience will like it because it will see themselves represented but it does so so so little with the material, not going any deeper in anything it tries to explore. All the characters are what you expect them to be: stereotypical as hell. The horror? Nope. You clearly notice this was made by someone in LA, NY or any other big american city. It doesn't have the rawness we would see in a story like this from a French or a Japanese director. It's unbelievable how a cannibalism story can be this boring, but here we are.An interesting - not that great, but creates the right mood - first act, good final 15 minutes and between that a terribly generic and almost empty second act. It tires really hard to be the new Promising Young Woman, but it's pretty forgetable.
good 'Fresh' is very good - strong performances and perfectly chosen music are the main reasons for that.I wouldn't say it's perfect, just because I don't think it nails the split between humour and seriousness but apart from that it's a terrifically made film. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan give excellent showings, while the music throughout is top notch. It's nicely paced and has an interesting story. Definitely one I'd recommend.
ok This is one of those films that actually has a really really interesting and out of left field twist that works in part........however the longer the film goes on the more silly, uninteresting and just plan dull the film gets. It needed a big ending and we didn't really get that sadly. It ends the way you thought it was going to end.Fantastic build up until then though, the first 45 minutes to an hour are really good!! Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones have great chemistry on screen but its not enough to keep me engaged towards the end.I will probably forget about this film and never watch it again, which is a shame!! It just needed one more reveal or twist towards the last 30 minutes and it might have stuck the landing........however that didn't happen, played it safe with the victims being saved. Which is odd considering the rest of the film isn't safe whatsoever!60% out of 100 its ok but had potential to me much much better than that!
good This was Insane!!! Sebastian Stan killed it, Boy does he look creepy! Daisy Edgar-Jones, don't know much about her, but she nailed it as well.Both the leads were freaking amazing. Who would tell the film would take such a shady, twisted turn after the first half an hour of mild courtship. Now hear me out, do yourself a favour and go in blind, don't watch any of the trailers, or read any kind of synopsis for that matter as they might spoil the fun. Believe me, if you do just I say, you are in for a bucket full of surprises!If you ask me, I just finished watching it, and I'm sitting in complete silence, don't know what to say, I've lost for words right now. What was that? Like seriously? What was it? Never in my wildest imaginations, I would see such a turn of events panning out. It's been a while since I've got this much of a shock factor from a Movie. I don't remember the last time I was this much bewildered, stunned. Now the film isn't flawless per se, there are indeed some problems yet I must confess, this is one of the best works I have seen in current times.It's gruesome, it's nasty, and it takes pride in showcasing the aspects of Blood & Gore. Be careful though, the film's subject is very much catered towards the people who love gore more than anything else. So, if you are a sensitive person, if the sight of blood or meat makes you uncomfortable, well just keep your distance. As some of the scenes will make you sick to your stomach. Trust me, I would like to share more details, but I won't do that. As a reviewer and a fellow cinephile, I want everybody to watch this. Nevertheless, it's not for the faint-hearted, that's all you wanna know, therefore proceed with caution!
ok The first scene was a little funny, maybe like 5 minutes, but the rest of the movie was pretty much horror. I don't know why comedy is listed at all? Maybe they think eating people is finny> This movie was pretty brutal and gory. Acting was good and ok story. I don't understand why people comment on woke stuff and politics and so on. It's a horror movie and just review it as such.
bad Just another cannibalistic serial killer holding their victims prisoner so they can toy with them before eating them. I can see these films far enough, it's already a tired cinematic plot, this film brings nothing new to the screen.
ok The ending is a bit rushed and the third act is slower compared to the second and first, but with good performances, captivating cinematography and solid direction, Fresh culminates into an enjoyable thriller.
bad I would have given this garbage D-movie a 0 rating if that was an option. I only watched it because Sebastian Stan is in it and I thought he was a serious actor with integrity. Have lost all respect for him. I know we all need a paycheck but this dung crossed the line. This movie is nauseating, disgusting, vile and has absolutely no reason to exist. Just more cultural pollution. It's obscene that this junk was written and directed by a woman.
ok What an utterly, utterly frustrating movie this was to watch, I had really high hopes, sadly they were dashed about ten minutes in.The first half of the movie, there are several words I could use, but let's just go with awful, it was dire, the second half of the movie was much better, but the damage was done.Ana de Armas is good, and of course looks glorious, her character is hideous though, Vic isn't much better. I did like Affleck in this though, his rather emotionless performance is odd at first, but makes sense as the movie progresses.The final sequences are incredibly over the top, you'll need to see it to believe it.Ultimately, it proves one thing, autocorrect is a setting on your phone best avoided. 5/10.
ok I'm slightly ashamed to admit I had 'Deep Water' on my list of 10 most anticipated films for 2022. With Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas on board I figured they must've been lured by a very good script that would be full of twists and seduction and style, much like 'Basic Instinct'. This film had none of those things I'm sad to say.I was shocked at how straight forward the story was. It could've worked as a mystery if nothing else. But no, even that they had to spoil by revealing all their cards incredibly early. From there you are just left asking yourself, where is this film heading? Is there some twist that's going to come out of left field and blow me away? Nope.Instead as a big finale we get a shocking chase scene between a bike and car - where the character in the car actually says "what, are you going to chase me down on your bike?" - and then yes that's exactly what happens. To be clear this is a pushbike. Chasing a car. I can't believe I watched that happen. And before that, where did the guy even come from? He just appears in the middle of nowhere with no context or reason for him being there. Surely a scene was cut out, but in the cut we got it seemed utterly bizarre.There is zero chemistry between Affleck and de Armas - which to be fair is kind of the point. They are in a loveless marriage so I guess that would make sense. It's not a lot of fun to watch however. The film can't decide if it wants to be erotic or not. It keeps hinting at things and starting intimate scenes, only to abruptly cut away. When de Armas realised how bad the film was did she ask for her nudity to be cut out?When this film got pulled from its theatrical release at the last minute I had a bad feeling. But I didn't realise it meant things were this bad. Man this film was a let down. I'm very disappointed. A generous 4/10.
bad The acting was fine, especially the daughter. But the writing was just terrible. I hate when adults write for kids and make them speak like they are 22 years old. There is no chance in hell that kid was that smart and intuitive.Second, there is no chance in hell a bank calls you and tells you about a check that bounced and then gives you who it was written out to, and then say that can waive the fee if you add money to your account They were rich so why would there even being sufficient funds? Never happened. And this is just one example where writers blow it. They don't need to add scenarios that don't happen in real life because it distracts us from what could have been good.Overall, this film was all over the place and served no real purpose. Besides their relationship never had in basis in reality. There was no rhyme or reason to it and no explanation whatsoever of how they went from seemingly distant to passionate for each other. It was bizarre.Did she ever wear something besides the black dress?Good luck trying to figure out what this film is about. It made no sense whatsoever. I guess Lyne wanted to rekindle his 9 1/2 weeks. Just a total lack of focus and very slow-moving and without much of a point this was a total WASTE OF TIME! SKIP!!
ok As "Deep Water" (2022 release; 115 min.) opens, we are introduced to Vic and Melinda, a married couple with a young daughter. For reasons unknown, Vic allows Melinda to have lovers on the side. Vic and Melinda are going out to a party, where Melinda meets up with her latest flame. Vic is not happy about it... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the return of director Adrian Lyne, whose previous film was "Unfaithful", 20 years ago. Lyne was in his late 70s when this film was made, but he hasn't changed his modus operandi one bit since his heydays in the 1980s (Flashdance; 9 1/2 Weeks; Fatal Attraction). "Deep Water" is based on the 1950s Patricia Highsmith novel of the same name. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment how close the film sticks to the book. What is clear is that with "Deep Water" Lyne attempts to revive the so-called "erotic psychological thriller" genre. Alas, it didn't quite work out that way. For that the storytelling is simply too thin and I was never fully invested in the film or in its characters. Ben Affleck tries his best with the weak material that he is given. Cuban actress Ana de Armas is obviously very attractive (and reminding of a Penelope Cruz of yesteryear). But in the end the various parts of the film don't really add up. When I think of "erotic psychological thriller", "Body Heat" immediately comes to mind. This ain't "Body Heat".Please note that this film was shot in 2019, yup, pre COVID-19, and its theatrical release was delayed a number of times until it was pulled from the theatrical schedule altogether. The movie finally premiered on Hulu this weekend. If you are a fan of Adrian Lyne's 1980s heydays, I'd readily suggest you check this out (keeping expectations low), and draw your own conclusion.
ok Vic (Ben Affleck) and Melinda (Ana de Armas) are a married couple with a young daughter. She's an unreserved flirt while he's terribly jealous and possessive. He tells her latest 'boyfriend' that he had killed before. Most accept this as a bad joke but his neighbor Don Wilson (Tracy Letts) sees it as a real confession especially after Melinda's latest 'boyfriend' turns up dead.I like the first half which feels like a mid-level mystery thriller from the 90's. Did he or did he not? That's the best aspect of this film. It's the heart of the matter. That's why it's a big mistake to do the big reveal so soon. The reveal happens way too soon and it saps the energy out of the movie. Otherwise, this would have been a fine mid-level film.
bad I'm not sure if it's proof of brilliant acting or proof of just how bad of an actor Affleck is, but after the second time he said I killed so and so, I said yeah, ok, I'll just go with that as my working thesis. That pretty much explained the rest of this insipid movie. I don't know, maybe I was supposed to say oh no, I'm sure Ben Affleck would never play a sociopathic murderer, but then I figured, why not? He's pretty much as wooden as any movie he's ever been in. Again that might be proof of good acting, since I think he actually was supposed to be a wooden post in this movie, but then maybe it's simply the material finally matching the talent, not the other way around. I guess I don't give much credit for a post acting like a post, since that's what posts do.As for Ana, well. One telling moment, after Affleck drowns some guy, and she says she's not scared because he did it for her. Uh, no, I think he did it because of her, which is an entirely different concept. Why he doesn't just kill her instead, or divorce her at least is beyond comprehension. It would save everyone so much bother. Sure she's good looking, but so what? He's a multi-millionaire, I'm sure he could find someone else who isn't a total... oh, what's the right word, there are so many possibilities, each of which I know will automatically cancel my review... well, let's go with an oldie, trollop, I hope that passes muster. I mean, I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers, but I guess I would if she wanted to turn me into a cuckold serial killer. I'm funny that way.There's not much point going into much detail of the movie itself, other than it is for the most part boring and completely unbelievable.The ending though is in a class by itself of stupidity. Besides the question of a guy on a bike catching a guy in a car, what exactly was the plan when he caught up to the car, either shake his fist angrily or slam into the car and become a pancake? Oh, but have no fear, better he should just fall on the road and instead of the car, oh, I don't know, running over him and popping his head off like bottle cap, instead we get a total rip off of Toonces, the cat who could drive. And if anyone asks is it really that bad? Yes, it really is that bad.I know what they're going for of course. It's supposed to be your standard mind f. But when stupid characters do the most stupid thing possible at every possible moment, it just doesn't count, it might be infuriating but only because of how stupid it is. Yeah, he's a terrible person who gets away with murder and she's a total, oh, what's the right word again... who knows what he's done and actually likes it. K. Got it. Now go away.I know this movie doesn't even deserve to be mentioned with something like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, except to say it's like that movie, if you took away the acting ability, the direction, the wit, the intelligence, the characters, the dialogue, the plot, the desire to say something, anything. Maybe it's more like Deliverance, if you remember the ending, only I don't mean Burt and his friends, I mean the other guys in Deliverance, you know the ones I'm talking about, though I think they might be rightfully offended to even suggest that they would be in a movie as lousy as this.My apologies.
bad This movie is horrible, boring, weird and stupid. End of review?I guess I'll say more. I could tell this was going to be bad 15 minutes into the movie. I seriously considered quitting at that point but felt like I needed to give it a chance. Bad decision. It's exactly what I thought it would be.The characters are ridiculously unlikeable. Don't get me wrong, I can love a character who is a terrible person. I'm all about the characters you love to hate. But these characters aren't just terrible people, they are horribly written with no redeeming qualities. And it doesn't help that they're in a useless story. Nothing about this movie works.I remember when streaming services were applauded for giving smaller movies a chance to be made. But we've gone so far in the opposite direction that I miss the days when certain movies were never made because... they didn't justify their own existence. This is an example of that. I can't understand who read this script and thought it's worth making. Streaming services continue to value quantity over quality. This movie is garbage. (1 viewing, 4/6/2022)SPOILERSThere is one part I have to mention. During the climax, Don sees Vic trying to hide the dead body in the lake. Surprisingly he does the smartest thing possible. Without saying a word, he immediately runs back to his car to get away from the killer. Wow, nice job movie...Then he starts driving, for a WHILE, and all I can think is, why aren't you calling the police? They're immediately cancelling the props I just gave for the smart decision to run.Finally he pulls his phone out. I think, okay now he'll call the cops. But instead... I legitimately cannot believe this... he starts texting his wife that he was right about Vic being the killer. Are you out of your minds? Whoever wrote this should be ashamed and retire from filmmaking.Of course, the text distraction causes him to crash and die. This is just lazy, atrocious writing. Do better please.
good Marketing this film as an erotic thriller was the biggest mistake they made. It does have some hot scenes but not enough to call the whole movie erotic even though the whole plot is around it. The thriller aspect is also more of an overlooking sense of it rather than the usual thriller sensibilities. The film is more of a character study of a couple, probably a psychopathic couple who feeds off each other by destroying each other and others who comes between them. Although the film takes a clear stand with the Husband, by making it clear it is the actions of the wife that pushes him to take action. But as the film goes on his actions looks like it's even worse but by the end, it's clear that the wife always knew this side and was really looking for that side in him all along. It's a very fascinating film for me because of how the characters are explored and the director makes us relate with a character who is as all the characters including him says, not normal and as we watch we realize that it is true in a lot of wrong ways. Can't believe this is getting so much bad reviews.
bad Kind of rich people (really rich before Reagan's tax cuts for the rich but just doing OK by billionaire standards of today), glamorous parties where everyone looks fab, a beautiful, talented wife he adores, and her string of boys she flaunts in front of him, like a cat that brings a dead mouse in the house just so you can see it, except hubby does the killing in this home.Once again, from the very beginning I can tell this won't be good because of the runtime of 1h54m which is way too long for this genre of film. Period. 1h30m is what this should be, but because it's for streaming services, they feel they have different rules and just want to plug up more over the viewers time, like their building a dyke to hold in our collective free time. With the extra twenty-four minutes, maybe we can read a few pages of a good book with a much better story than this one, like the one Patricia Highsmith wrote upon which this movie is based.How to shave off extra minute ideas:fewer cute kid bits (and FYI, kids her age who do science experiments don't listen to "Old McDonald")Less time showing how the beautiful people have a good time, because it looks really boring. Seriously, drinking games? Is this a frat house?Cut out hubby looking at wife with malice in his eyes while she cuckolds him, which brings me to what I really didn't like about this movie.Dude, just divorce her. The director really wasn't able to convince me why he would stay with her. In fact, he never even tried. Why didn't the wife leave him? It made no sense and was crucial to the story.Ugh, another story of a rich guy talking to a cop when he really should know to keep his mouth shut. In this day and age, I hate stories where this happens. "I don't have anything to hide." Dude, even if you are completely innocent and have the Pope as an alibi, you never talk to the cops. Everyone knows that, except bad writers it seems. "Would you be willing to take a lie detector test?" he's asked, to which he answers, "Sure, get one."And speaking of talking, the wife discusses fleeing to Brazil with her lover on the phone while her husband is steps away from her? Even for an unbelievably indiscreet woman, she has no discretion (he dead lover is barely in the ground, and she already has a new one with whom she plans to run away). And does she have to invite them all over to the house?Why does Vic have to be wealthy and a chip maker for drones? This part has nothing to do with the story and should have been left out entirely. Who cares? Why bother telling us about his snail fetish? It just takes up time and tells us nothing. Cut thirty minutes out of this and it may have been tolerable. It wasn't tolerable and took me all day to watch as I cleaned, cooked, played piano, read a bit and never really caring enough to get to the end of this mess.Can I ask film directors a personal question? Why do you guys shoot so many scenes in the dark where literally only about five percent of the screen is visible? Even if the scene is supposed to be at night, there's no need to make it so dark that nothing is discernible. If you don't want us to see images, maybe you should be working in radio.This really isn't a criticism of the movie, but first we're in Louisiana and then he's out mountain biking? And even riding down a switchback, you can't catch a car on a bike. Just silly and stupid...and then for the stupidity coup de grace, there is a coyote and road runner finale with the guy driving off a cliff...in Louisiana.
ok There's not enough plot to keep this nearly 2-hour long erotic thriller going, especially once it lets go of its initial ambiguity. The film is about a husband (Affleck) who's alright with his wife (Ana de Armas) romantically engaging with other men, growing increasingly jealous (and turned on!) by the proceedings. So, the wife Melinda is a hedonist - she lives for instant pleasures. She isn't particularly fond of taking care of their child - or the film rarely shows it. The husband Vic is hazily sketched - he's a retired drone-software guy, he loves threatening his wife's male friends and loves studying snails. His transition from accepting his wife's escapades to becoming a legit threat to the men involved lacks good bite - that's a screenplay problem, not the actor's!There aren't any scenes where he "loses it" or clarifies what he wants out of this seemingly broken relationship. On the other hand, Melinda is all about looking sexy all the time. And since we're picturing Ana de Armas here, it is an easily achievable tick. I didn't see much in the way of nudity or sexual content here, except for glimpses of "what could've been." Affleck makes for a believable bad guy while also being a doting dad. Armas' character needed better etching because it's tough to lean into her vision here either, though she scorches the screen with her presence. As a result, we get a predictable, somewhat tepid thriller that only partially does its job!
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Based on his work, arguments can be made on both sides. Director Adrian Lyne is either a staunch believer in monogamous marriages, or he enjoys mocking the concept altogether. Surprisingly, this is his first film in 20 years since UNFAITHFUL (2002). To refresh your memory, he's also the force behind 9 Â½ WEEKS (1986), FATAL ATTRACTION (1987), and INDECENT PROPOSAL (1993). Co-writers Zach Helm and Sam Levinson have adapted the script from the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Strangers on a Train"."Do you know I love you?" When one spouse feels the need to ask about love rather than declare it, you know it's an unusual marriage. And in the category of unusual marriages, you'd be hard-pressed to find an arrangement more bizarre than the one between Vic (Ben Affleck) and Melinda (Ana de Armas). Thanks to real life public drama for Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, we all know that "open marriages" are a thing. But this with Vic and Melinda is neither fully "open" nor fully a marriage. Vic invented and sold a computer chip used in drones (mostly for warfare) and he's so rich, that he'd rather watch his free-spirited wife drag home new boy-toys than give her an expensive divorce. But that's as much explanation as we receive for what seems like a lose-lose-lose scenario. That third lose is for Melinda's gentlemen friends who seem to mysteriously disappear once Vic becomes aware of them. One is gone before the movie even starts, and he's followed by Jacob Elordi, Brandan Miller, and Finn Wittrock.Perhaps the biggest mystery here is in deciding who displays more charisma, Affleck in this role or the snails that his character Vic breeds. We've joked about actors sleepwalking through roles before, but there are scenes here where that may actually be happening. Affleck mostly just dead-eyes Melinda and her men, though we are supposed to interpret his lack of expression as a combination of anger, jealousy, and lust. Fortunately, we have Ana de Armas to liven things up. She's a full-grown party girl going through various stages of designer dress and un-dress. The supporting cast is comprised of Dash Mihok, Lil Rey Howery (who is in every movie these days), Kristen Connolly, Grace Jenkins as the smarter-than-parents kid to Vic and Melinda, and Tracy Letts as a curious novelist constantly side-eyeing Vic as research for a new book.Is it cheesy? Yes. Is it sleazy? Yes. Despite twenty years of no movies, director Lyne delivers another high-gloss, play-pretend trashy erotic thriller that will fit perfectly in the streaming world. Affleck disappoints here after strong turns in THE TENDER BAR (2021) and THE WAY BACK (2020), and Ms. De Armas will next appear as Marilyn Monroe in BLONDE. Ben and Ana had their tabloid moment as a romantic couple after filming, but she is now the gone girl, and he has since reunited with JoLo. There are too many gaps in the story and characters for this to be considered a serious movie, but it's sure to be entertaining enough for many.Premiers on HULU beginning March 18, 2022.
ok ... this film is just weird-stupid in sooo many different ways... storyline is the absurd worst... along with the fact no matter how attractive she might be, that attractiveness is totally lost in the horrid character she portrays in this bleak-production... his acting is zombie-like to a ludicrous degree (normal-Affleck)... why movies like this get made at all is testament to the crap audiences are willing to accept over & again... somewhat improves with a second viewing... still crudely-ridiculous numerous scenes... there's greater appreciation for the overall story, ludicrous as it may be... the 1st viewing exposes the movie's flaws... in a 2nd, you'll know-bypass-them.. letting enjoyment of their performances happen to a greater degree... a production that cannot-mustn't be-taken-too-seriously, just like the hidden-freaky-'marriage' it exposes... look for Catherine Springer's March 16th review... nails-it.
bad Hollow echoes of the pitiful Gigli, but the leading lady is slightly better than J-Lo. The script is just as execrable, as is the so-called acting of the monstrously overrated Ben Affleck (he's OK in comedy roles though: go and watch Mallrats). The direction/photography isn't exactly chopped liver, ergo the 3-star (that's 3 more than Gigli) salute. Still, it staggers the mind that this guy directed one of the greatest psychological thriller/horror films ever made, i.e. Jacob's Ladder. Plus it is a timely reminder that cellular phones are not the benevolent miracle the hoi polloi often treats them like. You know, there was a time when folks said the same thing about asbestos and the internet. Anyway, best to avoid this turkey altogether, unless surface beauty floats your boat.
ok I liked this film, I found it interesting and darkly funny in places. The story wasn't really fleshed out but there was enough to keep you intrigued. The woman was outrageous lol but it was entertaining. I think they should make a sequel. Alexa, make a sequel but with more back story.
bad I like Ben Afflec and Ana De Armas. I was disappointed in this movie. It at times felt like a cringy soft core porn murder mystery that you used to see on Cinemax at like 3am. If the point was that a cheating wife who makes her husband jealous enough to murder her lovers should stay with her murderer husband because he's a good dad, well that's sort of messed up.
bad Obviously one of those "lockdown" movies that never should have been made. A seasoned director in the form of Adrian Lyne, but his directorial days seem long in the past as this is a kind of awful, lunk-headed throwback to the marriage drama/psycho-thriller genre, but lacking drama or indeed thrills. Ben Affleck has never been more wooden as the boring husband and poor old Ana De Armas is forced to strip in her third big film following KNIVES OUT and NO TIME TO DIE; an inexperienced actress like this just doesn't have the chops for the role. The hilarious climax copies the opening of Schwarzenegger's COMMANDO, but that's ten times the film this is.
ok It is a dark story of strange love between very strange people , with a very strange dynamic ) And , probably , it could have been better . Nevertheless ,I t kept me interested , engaged and entertained .Solid 7 stars .
bad Wow, what a completely waste of time, talent and money!I am sorry, usually I give every movie a chance and I really like Ben Affleck dramas and Ana de Armas is great, too. But, who wrote this garbage? It does not make any sense at all. No sense. And the ending is just painful to watch.Yes, I understand this is a character study but please give us some more information on the characters.Now come the spoiler parts:
ok And the feet?! So many unanswered questions... I kid but seriously what was with this movie? You keep waiting for something interesting to happen, something to ratchet up the tension, but it never comes. The story is just as straightforward as it seems and you can predict where the characters will end up by the end.There are pieces here to make a great thriller. Affleck gives a great performance and de Armas is vexing as always. A veteran director of acclaimed erotic thrillers, some genuine star power, and a uneasy mood all combine for a promising picture. The script just really drags the film down.
ok There are some moments when it looks like this will get better, but never does, even with a good job by Affleck.Not thriller enough, not erotic enough and definitely not credible enough. I still can't believe how clueless and incompetent that police is when everyone is dying or disappearing around that same couple and nothing is done (even with accusations). A guy dies in a pool and they don't see the marks of being drowned by other person? I rest my case.
bad Not sure if it's proof of great acting or what a terrible actor Affleck is, but after the second time he said I killed so and so, I said ok, fine, I'll go with that as my working thesis. That pretty much explained the rest of this insipid movie. I don't know if I was supposed to think oh no, I'm sure Ben Affleck would never be a sociopathic murderer, but I figured, why not? He was pretty much as wooden as any movie he's ever been in. Again I don't know if it's proof of good acting since I think he actually was supposed to be a wooden post in this movie, but it might just be the material finally matching the talent, not the other way around. I guess I don't give much credit for a post acting like a post, since that's what posts are supposed to do.As for Ana, well. There is one telling scene just after he drowns some guy and she says she's isn't scared because he did it for her. Uh, no, he did it because of her, which is an entirely different concept. Why he doesn't just kill her instead or at least divorce her is beyond comprehension. It would save everyone so much bother. Sure she's good looking, but so what? He's a multi-millionaire, I'm sure he could find someone who isn't a total, oh, what's the right word, there are so many that would fit but would guarantee my review would not be allowed, well, let's go with an oldie, trollop, I hope that passes muster. Sure I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers, but I would if she was trying to make me into a cuckold serial killer. I'm funny that way.As for the actual movie, there isn't much to say, other than it is mostly boring and unbelievable.The ending however is in a class by itself of total stupidity. Besides the question of a guy on a bike catching a guy in car, what exactly was the plan once he did catch up to him, either wave his fist angrily or smash into the side of the car and turn himself into a pancake? But have no fear, instead he falls on the road, only instead of the car, I don't know, running over him and popping his head off like a bottle cap, it turns into a total rip off of Toonces, the cat who could drive. And if anyone asks is it really that bad? Yes, it really is that bad.It's obvious what they're trying to do. It's a standard mind f. But when stupid characters do the most stupid thing every time, it doesn't count, it might be infuriating but only because of how stupid it all is. He's a terrible guy who gets away with murder and she's a total, oh, what's the right word again, who knows what's he done and actually likes it. K. Got it. Now go away.I know it isn't right to even mention this movie in the same breath as something like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Except to say it's like that, if you took away the acting ability, the direction, the wit, the intelligence, the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the desire to say something, anything. Maybe it's more like Deliverance, at least the ending, only not Burt and his friends, it's more like the other guys in Deliverace, you know who I'm talking about, though to be fair I'm sure they would be rightfully outraged to even think they would be in a movie as lousy as this. My apologies.
ok Ofcourse i watched this for affleck and ana, movie is just full of ana, the story had so much potential but they just messed up and it felt too flat, idk why two talented actors chose this kinda script, overall its a below average watch.
ok We find ourselves watching a volatile marriage on the edge. Melinda enjoys the company of many other younger men she brings home with her while legally married to Vic - Husband. Melinda childishly provokes jealously and hostility in Vic and for a not understandable reason, Vic put up with it. Does she measure Vics love for her by how far he will go to dispose of her casual suitors? What does Vic get in return? Apex male standing? Or is this just a sick and twisted game that both Melinda and Vic play to serial murder many young men.The film keeps you riveted to find out the motivations. With some victims, Vic makes some careless mistakes while other murders are discreet. The more Vic inflicts his rage, on the younger men, the more sexually attractive Melinda becomes to Vic and the more she is disposed to him.The film is extremely well acted by both Ana de Armas and Affleck. Affleck is particularly good at these psychological crime dramas. I still remember Gone Girl (2014), that was a really great film by Ben Affleck too.My one problem is there doesn't seem to be a point to the murders. Well, a part of me loved when Don Wilson drove off the cliff in his Subaru Wagon..Edit 3/24/22 ----I see a lot of criticism about Ben Affleck and Ana De Armas. Hey, these actors are incredibility good. Especially Affleck since we have other films of theirs to judge their skills. Separate the actors from the screenplay. They are doing the best they can with was provided to them. If you are hired as a contractor to build a house but the buyer provides you with cheap materials, you can't blame the contractor. They are working with what was provided. Same applies here. Despite the screenplay, Ben and Ana made it entertaining. If it had a better screenplay, I would have given it a much higher score. Criticize Zach Helm and Sam Levinson for the absurd script, but not these two actors. âœŒ
ok So let me get this straight. After she realizes he's basically a serial killer and will literally kill people for her, everything goes back to normal? Everyone just goes on living happily ever after? Lol..Ok I guess that works but how did it get to that point in the first place. There was no backstory whatsoever. Why was she so vindictive? What did this guy do to? When did their relationship go sour? There was really no explanation on why she was sleeping with other men while they were living under the same roof. They weren't even going through a divorce. She was literally hooking up with other guys right in front of his face. Is that just a thing people do these days to avoid a messy divorce? Guess so. Either way I still somewhat enjoyed this movie. I didn't really no where it was going, but I will say it all tied together in the end. 6 stars.
ok I am guessing from the low 5 overall rating (at the time of this review) that people are judging this harshly. Is it perfect? No. Is it going to win any awards? No. What it is is a fun psychological thriller about an unhappy dysfunctional marriage.Vic knows his wife is cheating on him. She flaunts her affairs in front of him and calls him passionless. That begins to change when he tells one of her lovers that he killed a man she had been sleeping with which starts the rumor mill flying. No one believes it. They take it for what it is a man lashing out at the guy who has been sleeping with his wife. But then another one of her lovers ends up dead and it becomes clear that Vic isn't lying about killing the men his wife is sleeping with. The question is when his wife is confronted with it what will she do? What will a woman who craves passion do with a husband who murders to keep her?
bad It's a joke of a movie, it's so weird that in this age of intellect and creativity.. people can make a movie like this . Never expected Akshay to make a movie like this what a waste ..
bad First you build a character of director who wants to make movie, sure good enough. Then she fools her own best friend Arshad Warsi, not giving the role in the script and than the whole emotions for a possible conflict is thrown away.Then we build a story of Akshay Kumar, and even unnecessary love story, fuses story of Rangastalam movie's ending and fool him to make him be a caricature of his own personality.And the director who makes movies, should be understanding character have no sensible understanding of how the gangster really is. Seriously!The Kriti Senon as a Director got to be more dumb than whole people who have no ground reality situation.They used 3 4 film's story from Tamil to Telugu's two different movies and made KACHARAA FILM.. It's seriously one of the stupiest film ever. There is seriously some problem with writer, direction.
bad Too many cooks spoils the broth this line is so true for this movie. There are 6 writers for this movie which is not even an original story. Bollywood has to give it's audience good content to watch otherwise with these types of flashy nonsensical, non-original movies will slowly start to keep audiences away from threater. There is nothing good about this movie not even songs, actors like Pankaj Tripathi has been wasted and producer-director seems to bank on one person's stardom, this is not going to work. STOP MAKING THESE TYPES OF MOVIES.
bad We should not waste our time, money and positive energy in these wasteful 3 hours drama of non sense action, songs. Instead we should do reading or even watch good movies again.
bad So much loud annoying bgm, cringy acting, story is non existent, very bad copy movie. You guys don't even know how to make copy of a copy of a Korean movie ..
bad Boring movie , akshay is repetitive acting is unbearable, i think its time to boycott bollywood , total time waste, they cant even make remake good. They cant copy, watch instead telugu version.
bad He can't act and giving the same old cringeworthy expressions which we are used to by his garbage movies. If you want to watch the better movie on same subject, watch the Tamil remake 'Jigarthanda' or the original South Korean movie 'A dirty carnival'.
bad Zero story and poor direction so naturally acting is sub-standard. Avoid and invest your money by watching TKF once more. Director (naam hi kafi he) thought he can divert the earning of TKF by releasing this movie. But now audience is smart enough to understand the trash and treat the movie accordingly.
bad What happened to Akshay Kumar. Is he just making movies for money. Don't care about the script at all.Akshay Kumar really needs a quality check of script and maker of the movie before saying yes to do the movie.Direction and Dialogues by Farhaad Samji are the worst thing happened to with this remake.Dialogues, screenplay, Direction are just pathetic.The whole casting of this movie deserves better movie or better Director.Why... why... just why Farhad Samji getting to make movies is beyond my understanding.Are producers that stupid to trust in Farhaad Samji.They couldn't even do a Simple copy paste job in remake as well.Such a shame!!!!+ve: Cinematography and Casting-ve: Direction, Screenplay, Dialogues are the worst.2/10 which this movie deserves.It's better to watch Jigarthanda in Tamil.
bad Huge Disappointed. Bachchan Pandey is like Phata Poster Nikla Zero. Suggestions is that better to watch The Kashmiri Files One more time Or Repeat and Repeat again. Worst Film Worst Acting Worst Screenplay.
bad Producer - i don't care about money, i need a good remakeDirector- yes sir I got exactly what you want,
bad Another disaster of Akshay Kumar Loading. Worst film of the year. Useless acting by akshay Kumar. Disaster written all over it. Save your money don't watch it in theater. After Bell Bottom another disaster of Akshay Kumar.
bad Cant bare over acting of actors, direction is eorst, akshay kumar AKa as remake star,, please guys dont watch its a waste of money and time, 100 crores renumaration for akshay for worst movieðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸support kashmiri filesðŸ‘ itsbest.
bad At the same time, the story of waste has been put, nor is it a foot to remain intoxicated. Over acting in the name of acting nonsense story in the whole picture. The more I thought it would be a better picture, the more nonsense it is. I would say only one thing, don't see, don't see.
bad Trash story, trash acting by Canadian Akshay Kumar, trash music, trash direction, trash editing, trash cinematography, trash movie. Overall everything related to this movie is freakin trash. Just like Canadian Akshay Kumar's Masooda.
bad Again remake of South Indian film. Bollywood can't make original story movie. Unnecessary songs mocking hindu culture. Total waste of time. No star should be given for such type s of movie.
bad I think this movie will be worst movie of this year. And no story and acting skills is bakwaas. Don't make a remake. Bollywood has finished because Bollywood producers have no skills of writing story, content, actions. Bollywood time is over. Now people's are not interested in watching Bollywood movies. So stop making this stupid bakwaas movies.
bad Please grow up and do some original and real. Dont take us and our money for granted. We are spending our time not to see such overacting. Its unbearable. Dont shove Akshay Kumar into our throat. Being in industry for so many years he hasnt learned acting.
bad No story and pathetic casting. Avoid please. The start gave goosebumps but just 2 mins into movie, you realise what a cartoon movie this is. Both halfs of movie are super bad.
bad I had no expectations when I watched this movie. Thank god for that ... if I had any expectation at all from the movie, it would have resulted in a bigger heartburn. One of the worst movies of all times. Calling it a disaster Is an understatement. Even Coolie No 1 (Varun Dhawan) appears like a classic in front of Bachchan Pandey.The movie is about a don in Hindi heartland Bachchan Pandey played by Akshay Kumar, who goes about mercilessly killing people. A wannabe filmmaker played by Kriti Sanon plans to make a movie on him to resurrect her film making career. While her plan is initially to write a script itself, during the course of the events she clicks him to act in the movie with hidden cameras. The final output of the movie and what happens to the characters constitutes the remainder of the movie.The acting is superficial and the casting is atrocious. Akshay Kumar just doesn't speak the usual language of the Hindi heartland. The dialogues are simply hopeless and there was not a single dialogue in the movie I remember. There was not even a single comic scene that made me laugh my heart out.Less said about the screenplay the better. I advise anyone planning to watch the movie to hold on and watch RRR that is releasing in a couple of days.
bad Senseless, Boring movie. Akki should retire now.Go feed some poor man with this money and get some blessings. Waste movie. There are other good content movies going on in cinemas which are already in 100 cr. Club. Check that out.
bad Even if I don't compare the film with it's original, this film is still boring, badly written & has nothing to offer. It doesn't bring empathy towards any character, there is no chemistry between any characters - everyone is acting like a mechanical toy that needs to be keyed every few seconds.Every actor's acting is below average. I just couldn't digest Akki in this serious role. I could digest him in Baby where he takes a serious role or for that matter even the badly made Airlift feels better.By the way why in the hell is the poster showing Akki wearing vibhuti and kumkum when there's no such scene in the film? Pathetic. And what is that spelling 'Bachchhan Paandey'??? Bollywood will mess up kids' education even with grammar and spellings. Yuck!
bad Akshay Boo-mar, kyunki ye movie dekh kar apko "booo" marne ka man hoga.Whenever you see Akshay, "boo-mar"!Boo, Boo!On a serious tone, this movie is very badly written, it is just not a good movie, at all.
bad I have watched this movie today and total waste of money. I should have watched #TheKashmirFiles. Going for it tomorrow.Please do not waste money on remake content, go for The Kashmir Files.
bad First of all, it is unbearable to see Akshay Kumar all over the place 24/7. We are so sick of his face and same acting every single time. Don't put any hopes on Kriti as it's just a pathetic script.If you're going to remake a remake, make it better. But this is one of the worst films of all time.Ask for a refund from the cinema!
ok Adela (Ana de la Reguera) and Juan (Tenoch Huerta) are a couple crossing the border illegally. The Purge has been reinstated by the new government. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is hunkering down on his Texas ranch with his family; his sister Harper (Leven Rambin), his pregnant wife Cassidy (Cassidy Freeman), and his father Caleb (Will Patton). Adela and Juan join others in renting sanctuary. They all survive the night but there are those who want to extend the Purge to an everyday reality.This is trying to do more social commentary. I'm fine with that as long as it's done logically which isn't always the case with this franchise. The logic does take some leaps here and there. The biggest leap is the open borders. The first move for Canada and Mexico would be to close the borders. It's not actually necessary. The story could have looped back to the tunnels with the closed border. Then there is the truck. It's not bulletproof people. The movie should stop treating it as such. Finally, I don't like reducing the final battle to those weapons. The lasso is too silly. It's trying to do something that takes away its realism. This movie comes with quite a few issues but then that's this franchise. All of these movies come with issues.
bad Awful stereotypes all round in this terrible umpteenth version of the Purge.Come on people! If you keep going to see these movies, they will only continue to make more.
ok Honestly they have stretch this series to the max now.I had high hopes going into this one but it turned out to be mildly entertaining and nothing more.Nothing original but a bunch of red necks that take mater into there own hands to prolong the purge.
bad Nothing creative just crude excessive stereotyping & clichÃ©s on human behavior. Very simplistic political categorizing. (Must be the Trump influence.) Americans are more divisive than ever & the ones with the bigger guns are on the rampage. Predictable who lives, who dies. Humorously, Mexico is now the destination for freedom. The usual cheap artificial looking evenly spaced burning cars/trash along with nicely placed bodies on the streets to denote rampaging killers.
bad Or is it Purge 365 days? They try to take this franchise in a new direction but not all new ventures lead you to the golden path (it becoming a classic)The claustrophobic nature of the Purge is opened up & it loses its tension. The protagonists are ok & the social commentary on racism in USA (especially the increased violence toward Asians during this pandemic, but replaced them with Mexicans and white supremacists) & the link to how media can fuel the extremists to violence.It could have been something half decent but instead ends up being a generic & uninspiring.
bad Extremely predictable with some preachy and crude political message. I never felt nervous when the Mexican woman got trapped because I knew she'd be saved. I didn't feel nervous when she got trapped at the back of the police van with a skinhead nazi because I knew she'd be saved. She got abducted by the racist white guy at the border in the desert and I didn't feel anything at all because guess what? I knew all along that she and her lover would be saved. No tension, no surprise, no killings but just b-action-movie shootings and no payoff; only horrible CGI and ridiculous dialogues. I'm officially done with anything related to Purge.
bad The Forever Purge is the fifth film in the Purge film series. The movie is directed by Everardo Gout, this is only the first movie he has directed and before this he has only directed TV episodes of various TV series.In the film, the US government has restarted the annual Purge program. For example, there is another night in the year when all crimes including murder are allowed. When the Purge night is over, a cult decides to break the rules and go ahead with the Purge. Juan (Tenoch Huerta) must now protect his own family and the family he works for from the criminals who are now breaking all the rules.That this film was made by a novice director and the writer of all Purge films is reflected in the quality of the film. The Purge events seem a bit repetitive and exaggerated and are portrayed in a cheap way. For example, many deaths are filmed off-screen, so that you often do not get to see the end result.By now playing the Purge events in daylight, the film does lose the tension that slasher films have by letting the killer commit his murders in the shadows of the night. This way you can also see the cheapness of the film earlier. Slasher fans may be annoyed by the cheap and unrealistic horror effects. Dolls were used for the dead bodies and the fake blood is thicker and darker than real blood. Furthermore, they only try to create tension with jump scares, but most of them are predictable and don't work like that.Like the other Purge film, the film also has a political message. This time it's a lot about how hard it is for immigrants in a new homeland with a corrupt, racist society.The film cast also consists more of actors who have played more TV roles or only minor movie roles. Most also play characters that aren't really developed in the film, making the viewer quickly forget their names and what they do. When a name is mentioned of a character who has disappeared or has been killed, you often do not know exactly which character it is.
bad I didn't go into this film with high expectations, knowing the other four films to the series aren't the greatest, but The Forever Purge is a fat waste of time! The premise seemed to have promise coming in, but Everardo Gout straight up missed the mark, making the film way too political, rather than having political ties, and an interesting concept. The Forever Purge had cardboard cut outs for characters, cringey acting, a shallow script, with horrendously cheesy action sequences.
bad Out of all the Purge movies, I only liked the second one. And that says more about how awful the others were. The first was just a clichÃ© slasher movie, the second was a step in the right direction (a dystopian action thriller) the third was just ok but the absurdities (a girl who can't afford a candy bar can afford golden AK's ?) and the way too biased political overtones ruined it for me. The fourth Purge (aka the first Purge) I couldn't even finish, let alone this one.The movie starts with poor helpless Mexican crossing the US border, it already sets the tone for the rest of the time. Then we have this native American dude preaching all this love and tolerance crap to those 'dumb ignorant white masses' it was painful to watch. The moment I really lost it was when that old farmer (whatever his name was, I don't care) started blabbering about "the rich get richer at the expense of the poor since we stole the land from the Indians blablabla". If you want to preach to your audience at least come up with something more original than this.Even if you look past the political nonsense it's still a half assed movie. I never cared about any of the characters or the story, there is barely anything exciting going on. The story just drags along with some occasional violent scene covered up with some pseudo-political message just to keep going.I'm fine with political/social commentary in (horror) movies, but don't shove this kind of woke junk in my face. I can always watch the Karen movie for that.
bad The Forever Purge had potential to be an interesting addition in the purge universe but unfortunately fell flat with the disappointing plot and predicable jump scares. If this is the first Purge outing for you it won't be such a letdown, maybe wait until its on another platform instead of paying for a cinema ticket.
bad I hate that it's no longer a horror franchise. I am a horror fan. All the politics seemed forced too. I only liked the first two Purge movies. I didn't care to see the rest because I lost interest and I was starting to hate the politics and the acting of the Franchise. Nothing ties this movie together. There no emotion for us to care about the actors. Complete snoozefest. The whole series is about wealth, race and social issues. Movie was too political , was expecting a purge film / thriller. They touched too much on ethnicity etc. This movie was straight up hateful propaganda and people don't even realize it. It was full of the most corny stereotypes possible. It was trash.
bad Lol just when you think they would learn, they don't and create this pile of stool. This movie is awful and preachy. I mean you already knew it would be.
bad I wish I could write a better review, cause I fell asleep midway. Terrible. Even the action is boring. Absolutely no suspense. Didn't care for the western set up either. Oh well. If you're a true Purge fan, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Can't beat the first Purge. That's about it. If you need a good nap.. be my guest. Actually, you might like it if you're 12.
ok Directed by Everardo Gout and written by series creator James DeMonaco, this is yet another example of "the last Purge" before they announce another sequel. That said, this series has gone from middling to decent to actual pretty good to middling all over again, so I was happy that this pushes the Purge in a new direction: once the killing starts, it won't stop. Sure, the series has gotten pretty heavy handed, but if the last few years have taught us anything, it's that the Purge is closer than ever before.These films always get laughed at for the way they handle social issues and then they make over $52.8 million worldwide over its $18 million budget.Eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election -- The Purge: Election Year -- the New Founding Fathers of America have regained control of the U. S. government and have re-instituted the Purge. Racism has gotten out of control and this years Purge seems like it will cause more damage than anyone can imagine.I mean, you can totally see how they tore this from the headlines. That's kind of why I have a soft spot for these movies, which feel like the last gasp of the exploitation movies that we love that would stare a cynical eye on what was really happening and figure out how to make some money off of it.Despite all of the film's main characters surviving the Purge, the next day the killing continues thanks to a faction called the Forever Purgers, who have decided to turn the tables on the rich and show them what it feels like to be undervalued.It's easy to be snide and think these films are a waste of time, but for some reason, I've found something to enjoy in every film after the first one. I'm really looking forward to Frank Grillo's character Leo Barnes coming back in the next film, as his journey between The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year made for a great story.
bad Poor writting, mediocre direction and pretty lackluster performances attached to a film thats messages have all the subtly of a sledgehammer to the face make for a very poorly handled mess with more contrivances, coincidences and plotholes than you can count on both your hands. Add on to the fact it takes itself way too seriously. Much of the actiom is shakey cam and cuts away before you see anything too violent. The worst of a dying franchise.
good Despite controversy I loved The Forever Purge! I'm pretty sure it's the most violent installment, quite disturbing, and I absolutely love the masks/makeup. Josh Lucas did so great, refreshing to see him in a more action based roll most anything else wasn't as much. The Purge movies tend to get a lot of hate and I'd highly recommend this one! I really like the writing and producers as well.
ok I really enjoyed the Purge movies ... some more than others. But it seems they have run their course, right? I'd say a hard yes - still even though I thought the last one (before this one then) would be ... well the last one, they did this one.I don't mind - and even though they dialed the politics back a little bit ... they are still very present here. This time it is about immigration and you won't need long to find out the message of the movie. The movie has some pacing issues and cliches will be up front and center ... still entertaining as much as it can be.
ok I think you know going into a purge film what to expect but this film did it better than I expected it to.There was plenty of the usual action but with plenty twists and turns and a perfect pace.Well worth a watch if this is your sort of thing.
ok All anyone EVER wants to do is kill. No one wants to rob a bank, break into an best buy, NOTHING. And THEN they try convince you that purgers would be able to drive the US MILITARY from it's own base?! ABSOLUTELY not. Bland storyline, decent acting.
bad When I saw the poster on an social app I thought it was a joke... wow milk trash more pls... Jesus hollywood is dead rip.
bad Although i like the first 3 purge films and hated the first purge my expectations were not very high for this one and man the movie was Disappointing....first half was bad the second half was way to predictable like we knew that they will kill the Mexican guy who fell in love with the American guy's sister. Not only that, in climax when they are left with 0 ammunitions they all are hiding behind the bus in an completely open field and still they all were able to escape like watt!!??..Overall the movie had nothing new to offer, won't recommend it.
bad July 2021 This is much better than I expected. It is very intense, and it's also intensely distributing. I find myself very involved with the story and the fate of the characters.
bad IN A NUTSHELL:
good I don't know why people are saying it's crap, it was actually refreshing that the main characters won and didn't die, the native Americans, the Mexicans and the affluent ranchers all came together, stuck together and made it out alive.There wasn't as much violence and I am glad as the previous Purge films were a bit much I think they toned it down due to all the people suffering mentally with Covid. I adore Josh Lucas and the rest of the cast. Give this film a go.
bad "The Forever Purge" would be much better as "The Final Purge". It would make complete sense, considering the completely irrational and senseless government of this terribly dystopian version of America could finally shut down the annual purge after the events of this disastrous film. Alike the previous Purge movies but focusing on a completely different story, this film revolves around the yearly purge. But instead of having the entire movie centred on these violent 12 hours of legal crime, it's set after the event when some mindless fools decide it's not over and never will finish.James DeMonaco actually deserves some credit for this instalment due to the fact that instead of revolving around a group of people getting unwillingly involved in the purge, he attempted to place the spotlight on the aftermath when the criminal activities are illegal. Unfortunately, he and the other directors who execute his ideas make dumb borefests with bloody horror-context action.The final picture, alike the previous films, hires poor actors who deliver unlikeable and uninteresting characters. The violence and death will appeal to fans of this movie collection, but each sequence in The Forever Purge is absolutely weakened by predictable turns, foreseeable jump-scares and devastating plot holes. There's nothing new or clever that the other Purge films didn't achieve and the entire story is instantly forgettable.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.
good I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).
ok In 1979 a group of people rent a cabin to make an adult film in rural Texas. The owner is less than pleased and has issues of his own with his wife.The film is over-hyped. It does have two creepy looking old people who look like something out of Texas Chainsaw. The soundtrack was top rate, as is anything that includes Mungo Jerry. It also has the throwback nudity many horror films have started to avoid. This film reminded me of "Bread Crumbs."Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Mia Goth, Brittany Snow)
ok An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.
bad My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !
ok While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.
ok In 1979 a bunch of young filmmakers set out to rural Teaxas to film a porno film. They rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere from an old guy. They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick! Worth a look but the buildup to the blood and guts is kind of slow.
bad Instead of getting a horror movie of the 70's, you watch a group of junkies going to make a porn movie on a farm, which turns out to be nothing but a long drawn out build-up, before they get wiped out but one. Some people call it a slow burner, but they're wrong, it doesn't even get lit.
bad Boring. Pointless. Unrealistic (old people who can barely stand upright are somehow capable of killing a group of young adults!!!). Can't believe people are rating this movie so highly!!!
good I saw X, starring Mia Goth-Suspiria, Everest; Jenna Ortega-Scream_2022, Iron Man 3; Brittany Snow-the Pitch Perfect movies, John Tucker Must Die; Martin Henderson-Grey's Anatomy_tv, Everest and Kid Cudi-Don't Look Up, Need For Speed.This movie is-in the words of one of the characters-one F$#@^& up horror movie. I will say, it is original. It takes place in 1979 Texas-it was actually filmed in New Zealand-where a group of young filmmakers go to a rural farmhouse to make an adult movie. Martin is the producer that rents the farm location and Mia, Brittany and Kid are the films' stars-and yes, there is graphic nudity. Jenna is handling the equipment behind the camera. One of the first things you notice is that there is something odd about the old couple that own the farm, especially the old woman. Slowly, things become clear about the intentions of both of the farm owners and it gets bloody violent. FYI: Don't leave until after the end credits because there is a scene you do not want to miss and I read that the sequel-actually a prequel-will be out later this year.It's rated R for bloody violence and gore, drug use, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.I loved this horror film and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.
ok 5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a "sexy slasher" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes.
ok After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.
ok A decent slasher, but does not deserve a 96% rating on RT. The kills felt conveniently cheap and honestly everything was underwhelming. I was hoping to to feel paranoid or scared, but didn't feel much of anything. Spent most of the movie hoping it would get better or surprise me a little but we've seen this all before.
ok ... there'd be plenty of flesh and gore and comical carnage to see, with disfigured torsos, extreme loss of blood flow, and attempts to escape but not being able to quite flee.... and it would be better than this.
good Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.
ok I expected a lot more from this movie. It felt a lot like a reboot of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Too many similarities and the overall story is hardly believable. Disappointed as Ti West has made some good movies before. This is not one of them.
good A very stylish rendition of original porn leading to some brilliant horror set in 1979 that is well written and fun to watch! X is surprising in all the right ways and very weird reminds me of M. Nights The Visit just more extreme. I was surprised to see Sam Levinson's name in the credits I love him and his projects! Ti West created something special, I've seen a couple of his films he seems to gear towards disturbed older folks which is quite effective.
ok This is technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movies best qualities.But the direction they take with some of the "horror" late in the movie is off-putting. I understand what they are going for. I understand that's the point. And the point does come across. It still doesn't change how I felt. Which was unsettled, not scared.Some people might like that type of "horror" (like Gabe from The Office lol). I am not one of those people. It's unfortunate because it's a good setup that just doesn't land for me. (1 viewing, opening night 3/17/2022)
ok A man looking for a get rich quick scheme decides to make a porn film on a Texas ranch in the video days of 1979. The place is owned by a creepy old couple who look like ma and pa kettle. The old lady is both horny and violent and a scene with geriatric peop!e getting busy is downright bizarre. The leads are fine but X is only an average horror movie.
good X (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres tonight. The storyline follows a production crew who rents an old house from a very old couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas to film a porno. As they make an outstanding porno hoping to change the industry forever they get some visitors looking to fulfill their own fantasies.This movie is directed by Ti West (The House of the Devil) and stars Mia Goth (Suspiria), Jenna Ortega (Scream), Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect), Kid Cudi (Don't Look Up), Martin Henderson (The Ring) and Owen Campbell (My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell it To).I love everything about this movie, how can you not like a slasher porno movie? The storyline is excellent and unfolds perfectly. This is a rare unique slasher film that horror fans have been clamoring for. I really liked the characters, the twists and turns and the full circle ending. The cast was perfectly selected. The cinematography and camera angles are out of this world, as is the use of lighting, sounds and the soundtrack. The kill scenes, gore and blood splatter are on point. The jump scares are perfectly executed and very well done with no cheese.This movie gives horror fans everything they want in a horror movie. I could watch this 100 times. I would score this a 10/10.
good Ti West is an incredibly astute visual director, and with X, he continues to show this. He turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.That being said, West has never impressed me with his writing before. His earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. Thankfully that's changed with this one. This is probably West's most character-filled film.Every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. The protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. Each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.It's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.Additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and I didn't get attached to them in the way I think West wanted me to.Still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than I was expecting.
ok "X" is a very bloody, and satisfying horror film from A24 that is able to pack enough scary moments, while also talking it's time to develop its characters.The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great. It's a very bloody movie and the final 40 minutes are amazing. It's also a very good looking movie. It's very well shot and there's a lot of creepiness to it. And finally I actually felt that the villains in this movie were actually very well portrayed. They were given a somewhat tragic issue, and it really added a lot to them.Now I do have a few negatives. The first being that I do wish there was a little more crazy moments. I wish the movie had just a little more bloody moments. I also felt that the first act, while good, was a little too slow paced. I wish it do move a lot faster. And finally there are some things aren't fully explained towards the end.Overall "X" is a very bloody good time with great acting, great direction, and some truly bloody moments.
bad Don't get the positive reviews, basic acting, boring plot and genuinely pointless, the story was just so dated and predictable.The kills
ok I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots.
ok This isn't like Ti West's other films. It's tasteless garbage with a few good scenes scattered throughout that end up being meaningless when the film descended into complete nonsense and shock value.
good This is probably the only Viking-related entertainment I have ever watched to thoroughly respect and appreciate our heritage. What a fantastic cast, cinematography and blend of realism and the supernatural. Absolutely masterfully crafted.Netflix and Marvel can try their best to ruin the image of my ancestors. All I can say is thank god for Eggers and The Northman.
good My first impression is that this is a contender for the Most Metal Movid. It's like when you first see The Wild Bunch with a good screen and sound, you leave with more chest hair than when you came into it (whether you're a man or a woman). It's brawny, bloody, brutal, graphic revenge fiction made by a filmmaker who is so sincere that any further to the right or left and it could could self parody. It never is and if I found myself chuckling over how unique a giant vision of how violence dooms.... everything and everyone.Eggers and his absolute Top of the Heap artisans and designers, from the designers of those trippy sequences to whichever team made *that* severed head to the volcano set piece and location scouts etc etc, manage to transport you to a time and place that is not familiar to I'd suspect 90% of us, and even for like a Game of Thrones comparison that has more of a modern sensibility and humor than this. Eggers and Sion manages to pack two semesters worth of study on Mythology into a little over two hours in a completely organic sensibility.But there's a mystery to parts of the symbolism here that I'm sure will keep me coming back to analyze things like the Supernatural and otherworldly (are they totems to the afterlife? What about the Valhalla woman on the horse riding into the sky? Well... all of a piece, right). Amid the transporting into this other realm is this sense that violence is so overencompansing it can swallow you whole.And the performances add to this feeling of fervor and intensity and with 11000% pathos going on in that similar sincerity with the design elements. And occasionally much needingly with Anya Taylor Joy, who is so strong as the pulsating beating heart beneath this thing. Someone like her character helps to not so much soften but balance out how almost everyone else here, certainly Skarsgard in a towering and angry but vulnerable turn but also Hawke in his time and Kidman when she gets her moments (next Oscar already throw her one she is staggeringly good), is firing on these cylinders of seriousness and primal rage and sadness and just.... fire is the word for it. If you've ever seen a Heavy Metal album cover the actors are channeling *every one that has ever existed* into this one film (Bjork being like the weirdo Norway metal for her minute or two).Robert Eggers has been a filmmaker to watch for a while now. With this, he joins the all timers. What a master. What a giant hunk of 20 pound steak of a movie with grizzled onions and hot pepper. Sorry guess it made me hungry for meat.
good The Northman's combination of a large budget and epic scale with a slow burn character drama make it an incredibly unique and rare film. A disturbingly violent yet breathtakingly beautiful exploration of the cycle of violence and it's burden on those it consumes.Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd gives a phenomenal lead performance, full of a ridiculously intense physicality balanced with a visible pain and trauma. Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible with steely eyed determination and Claes Bang is terrific, bringing depth and nuance to a possibly one note character.Robert Eggers' direction is excellent, full of satisfyingly long takes, visceral action and some truly surreal imagery. The music by Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan is perfect, skillfully switching between bombastic, haunting and beautiful.
good Like his memorable period piece freak-outs "The Witch" and "The Lighthouse," though on a vastly more ambitious scale, bloody and deliciously violent. The Northman is a big-budget epic, but it retains those indie roots, and in " Robert Eggers " fashion , very aesthetically pleasing. This film delivers ! Powerhouse performances and otherworldly imagery . I highly recommend at some point to see this blood-soaked odyssey !! Sooner rather than later. A cinematic saga. The cast in this one is absolutely incredible. Check out the cast ....
good An epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of Norse mythology. Its intense rituals, powerful imagery, guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience. Stunning scenery, brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
good Everything about this movie screams "beastly." Literal screams along with metaphorical ones. It's a beastly movie with a beastly cast giving beastly performances behind a backdrop of beastly cinematography scored with beastly music.I had a smile on my face for most of the movie. I was fully invested in the story and characters. The directing is top-notch with a style that gives the movie a character of its own. There are so many beautiful shots. And I give it major props for going all out and holding nothing back (we need more R-rated movies!!).In my review for Dune, I mentioned that so many scenes feel so epic even without action. Regular scenes of them walking are somehow epic. It's the same way with The Northman. It's filled with epic non-action moments, which are heavily aided by the music and cinematography. When this is the case, even the slow parts feel escalated.The entire cast gives great performances, but I need to single out Anya Taylor-Joy. I want her cast in every movie. She has the acting talent as well as a screen presence and charisma that has you glued to every scene she's in. I've liked her in everything I've seen of hers, which already includes so many great movies like Split/Glass, Last Night in Soho, and Morgan. We're witnessing the birth of a star. It's possible I'm a bit biased due to her being one of the most beautiful women on the planet.I highly recommend The Northman. If any cinemas in your area are playing it on a premium screen, it's definitely worth it. Unfortunately IMAX is still showing Fantastic Beasts. (1 viewing, opening Thursday EMAX 4/21/2022)
good THE NORTHMAN (2022) **** Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke, Anna Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe, Bjork. Filmmaker Robert Eggers' tone poem take on the Viking mythos focuses on the vendetta of vengeance that Amleth (an imposing yet vulnerable Skarsgard) seeks in the murder of his king father (Hawke) at the hands of his malignant uncle that echoes Shakespeare's MacBeth in oh so many ways. Cast with an impressive array of talent including Kidman as his mother with shades of Lady MacBeth and Taylor-Joy as his kindred spirit soulmate. Beautifully shot by Jarin Blaschke and a production design by Craig Lathrop transports you back to 895 AD with on location shooting in Northern Ireland adding to its epic visage overall. Brutal, brooding, dank and doom enlists the film with the ranks of SPARTACUS, BRAVEHEART & GLADIATOR with a hint of Inigo Montoya's blood oath of redemption; one of the year's very best.
good As it is kind of becoming Eggers trademark, you either love or hate his movies. This one is no different.Is it a realistic viking representation? I wouldn't know I'm no expert on that area, but I don't think that is the point of the film. It is definetely not trying to be realisticly accurate.Is it slow at times, kind of weird, and brutally shocking? Yes that is an Eggers film as it core. Be aware of that.Is it a very enjoyable, compeling, emotional, dramatic and somehow fantastical film about the obsession of revenge and destiny? Yes, absolutely.
good From the first frame you know that "The Northman" will not be an ordinary movie. Robert Eggers returns with another masterful story far removed from the horror genre (although with some present touches of this genre) and explores an epic story whose excellently written script surprises with each scene and each sometimes theatrical dialogue. The filming locations are tremendous and together with the first level cinematography, the costume design and a spectacular production they achieve a trip to the past and to the mythology of the Vikings. Eggers' film directing excels at every second and the performances are delightful, especially Nicole Kidman's, possibly the best performance of her career. The soundtrack is deep, the special effects shine from how excellent they are. "The Northman" is so far the best film of this 2022 and it can hardly be dethroned. Talking about this movie deserves nothing but praise, an instant classic!
good Greetings again from the darkness. After two incredible arthouse films that earned the label "visionary filmmaker" for Robert Eggers, some would not have been surprised to find him cashing in on a huge payday for the next colossal superhero movie. But for those of us who adore and respect him for THE WITCH (2015) and THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019), we knew Mr. Eggers was not the comic book type. Instead, he secured a hefty budget (still less than $100 million) and with his co-writer, Icelandic author Sjon (writer of last year's mesmerizing LAMB), created the most epic Viking movie to date ... while firmly maintaining his artsy stylings.Every now and then a movie comes along and I must accept that my words will fall short; that I won't be able to do justice to what I've experienced on screen. This is certainly one of those times. Based on the same Scandinavian folk tale that inspired Shakespeare to pen "Hamlet", this Eggers film is not just meticulously researched, it also pulls us right in so that we slosh through the mud and muck. We shiver from the cold. We feel the wind and the brutality of the violence. We live the harsh elements of Viking life.The film opens in the year 895 AD as young Prince Amleth welcomes home his battle-weary father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Not long after jester Heimer the Fool (Willem Dafoe) jokes about the Queen and the King's brother, the boy witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang, the excellent "Dracula" TV mini-series, 2020) strike dead the king. Amleth escapes, pledging to avenge his father's murder and the kidnapping of his mother, Queen Gudrun (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman). Flash forward twenty years and Amleth has become a behemoth of a man played by Alexander Skarsgard (Eric Northman in "True Blood"), who lives, fights, and kills alongside violent 10th century Vikings. Amleth is a hulking beast unmatched in battle, yet one who never unnecessarily harms women or children.His revenge plan leads him to the farming village where his mother and Uncle Fjolnir now live as wife and husband, an arrangement Amleth is certain she adheres to for her own safety and that of her new son. Bjork, in her first big screen role since DANCER IN THE DARK (2000), appears as the seeress who knows Amleth's destiny. It's here where Amleth meets Olga "of the Birch Forest" (Anya Taylor-Joy) and reveals his plan to her. Olga describes her supernatural abilities as breaking men's minds in contrast to his breaking their bones. The two are quite the match.Eggers stages a stunning final showdown with a naked sword fight atop a burning volcano to ensure we aren't subjected to an ending that falls short. The visceral savagery on the screen is somehow both brutal and beautiful. This is epic cinematic brilliance from Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who treat us to numerous long takes in harsh weather and discomforting action. This is 136 minutes featuring some of cinemas best faces, while also proving that visionary is simply not a strong enough word to describe director Robert Eggers.Opening in theaters on April 22, 2022.
good The NorthmanI thought it was brilliantThis movie is not for everyone due to the levels of violence and gore.It was an incredible mix of different elements that added up to an understanding of brutal Viking culture and how they may have lived. The different themes were fate, revenge, mythology and destiny.The mythological elements were handled with great panache, with highly stylised quasi dream sequences driving the chapters this could have been a disaster but here it worked in spades.There wasn't a lot of script it was all action and Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd was perfectly cast as the cast out revenge driven son, in fact the whole movie was stuffed with stars. All I can say Nicole Kidman is wow, who'd have thunk it! The jury is still out on Claes Bang, seemed wooden and Anna Taylor-Joy, had the look, but others may be more kind!It was long at 2 hours and 16 mins, and divided into chapters in a largely linear story. It was very original and any comparison would be crass but the nearest would be The Vikings with Kirk and Tony.I did laugh out loud as some spots, I wasn't meant to, but it was more shock admiration and absurdity than comedic.The director really got some stellar performances from everyone it was masterful in letting a talented group of actors let rip at their craft.The vision, direction, cinematography and finished product is an 8 outta 10, very original and deeply memorable, I am deducting a couple of marks, firstly I sensed some scene were inserted for shock value and were bordering on gratuitous, the romantic elements were just not well done.
good Robert Eggers does it again! This isn't just another viking movie, it is one of the BEST dramas ever! GREAT action & emotional too. A fitting end, while also setting up what's next. It is a stunning tale of betrayal and obsessive revenge. With excellent world building saturating every frame, it's one of the most transporting, magical, action-soaked films in some time. Must watch. 10/10.
ok This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping "The Northman" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is "The Green Knight", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but "The Northman" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold.
good It was finally time, Robert Eggers "The Northman" one of my if not the most anticipated movie of 2022 for me.I was i little bit worried that this movie wouldn't feel like a Robert Eggers movie now that there was some big companies involved in this, but boy was i wrong. The Northman feels just like a Eggers movie but with a bigger budget, and wow what a fantastic movie this was. A dark,brutal and Violent vikings tale with some incredibly beautiful shots and a Swedish viking in the lead role.The Northman feelt like a crossover betweeen The Green Knight and Gladiator and it might already be one of the best movies of the year.
good It's intense, dark, brutal and fierce! The ultimate story about blood vengence. Unlike the Vikings show (History channel) this movie is actually pretty authentic in terms of depicting the viking culture and lifestyle. Eggers certainly has put a lot of his signature storyteliing touch on it which gives the film a unique character. Perhaps not for everybody but most people will probably find it intereating and refreshing!
good Beautiful all around nightmare adventure of glorious might and vengeance. Robert Eggers biggest budgeted cinematic experience yet that is a striking art throughout! Alexander Skarsgard is in Tarzan shape that really shines in The Northman, he is perfect for this in every way. The Northman deserves awards or praise for decades at least. The buildup is so well done, acting is masterful, the cinematography is so beautiful color palettes and Eggers films are always well written!
good The Northman is unlike anything that has been released this year. Anya Taylor Joy killed it once again in her role. The whole cast was spectacular. I left the theater with my jaw hanging it was unbelievable. I thought I was on the set of this movie that's how real this felt. The last time I saw anything this good was last months The Batman.This movie is a must see film for any history buff or really anyone. The fight scenes are some of the best and most brutal that I have ever seen I thought I was going to get sick they were that good. I hope the Oscars remember this movie because this should win some awards.11/10.
good Robert Eggers, who watched the epic movie "The Juniper Tree" at the age of 14 and decided to become a director, is now a director who makes epic films. After he proved it with "The Northman", Robert Eggers was promoted to the side of those gods from a good regulation that follows the gods of cinema. A magnificent art direction, a unique cinematography, impressive musical scores, actors and actresses each serving a purpose...
good THE NORTHMAN might be the best Eggers movie to date. In all three of his films, he excels at capturing a sense of time and place, not just in the costumes, dialogue, and scenery, but in the way his story worlds evoke the perspectives of the historical people living in them. Just as THE WITCH could easily have been a horror tale told by the Puritans themselves, the universe of THE NORTHMAN is endowed with an otherworldly sensibility right out of myth.Just as compelling are the moral elements of the story. There are no white hats and black hats battling for supremacy-- everyone is flawed, scarred, and seeking vengeance. It's truly tragic and yet it all ends on a positive, life-affirming note.Absolutely recommended. I don't need to go to the theater for the rest of the year-- I cannot imagine anything else equaling this brilliant, savage work of art.
good This is a movie that I've been excited about. It feels like I heard about this movie a couple years ago and I'm assuming due to COVID, it got pushed back. Knowing that Robert Eggers as doing a new movie that was featuring Vikings and revenge, you had me in. The more that I heard about the cast, it piqued my interest even more. Now I got to see this early thanks to Fright Club Podcast, as they had a showing through the Focus group.We start this movie with Amleth (Oscar Novak) as a boy. He greets his father who is back from war. His father is King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) who is known as War-Raven. Amleth's mother is Queen GudrÃºn (Nicole Kidman). His world is turned upside when his father is murdered and Amleth flees. Years later, he grows up in the land of Rus, having joined another group of Vikings. Amleth is now a fierce berserker. His oath to avenge his father and rescue his mother never leaving his mind. He then sets out to do so. In the process, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and falls in love with her. It makes him question what to do.What I will say is that Eggers has done it again. I've seen all his movies in the theater. This is the one that needs to be seen there for sure. His care with making it feel like we're in the past is great. From the language to the look and the outfits, it is amazing. I like that we're given runes they'd use, the spelling of the things and just the care that was taken has it on point. We get a simple story, but the depths that Amleth goes to get his revenge is amazing. There is also a great cast which helps. I like the music that we get to help build the atmosphere. My experience here was worth seeing it early.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.
good The Northman: Not just another Viking tale, based on the Hamlet source material this is an epic. Viking Magic and the Norse Gods are an important part of everyday life in the unfolding of this narrative, In 895 AD the young Amleth goes through a rite of passage ceremony accompanied by his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), they both act and howl like wolves, the King's Jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe) presides over the ritual. A Seeress appears to the adult Amleth (Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd) and foretells his destiny, something he is as bound by as any Predestination believing Calvinist. Throughout the film this outcast prince comes into contact with mediums who guide him on his way and put him in contact with the dead. Physical objects are brought back from these supernatural encounters.After Amleth's father is slain by his uncle FjÃ¶lnir (Claes Bang) he flees promising to avenge his father and to free his mother, GudrÃºn (Nicole Kidman), who FjÃ¶lnir has taken as his wife. He is raised by a band of Berserkers, we see the Berserker Priest (Magne Osnes) lead the ritual in which his clan put themselves into a trance whereby they see themselves as bear-wolves. After a battle in Russia Amleth discovers that FjÃ¶lnir is now in iceland with GudrÃºn, disguising himself as a slave he sets off to fulfil his destiny. He meets and falls in love with Olga (Anna Taylor-Joy) a Rus Sorceress who is also a slave.The violence in this film is shocking at times but it reflects the age in which it was set, life was cheap. Even during FjÃ¶lnir's coup ordinary people are killed because they literally were in the way. During a Berserker rage Amleth bites the throat out of a Rus warrior but after the battle other Vikings in cold blood slay women and children who aren't useful as slaves. Slaves who mightn't last the winter are slain by Viking farmers. Gore flows through this saga and if you are squeamish or faint of heart then it is best to avoid The Northman. A thrilling story of adventure, betrayal, a thirst for revenge and the acceptance of a fate which is inevitable because it is foretold by the Norns. A few twists add to the tension which permeates the film. Great performances by SkarsgÃ¥rd, Taylor-Joy, Dafoe, Bangs and Kidman. Directed by Robert Eggers, co-Written by Eggers and SjÃ³n. 9/10.
good Young director Robert Eggers is back at it again with his most recent take on a movie based around vikings, now first of all I have to give full credit to the film when it comes to capturing the brutality of vikings because it is done spectacularly. The film itself is entertaining and the cast delivers great performances all around, this role shows that Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd has what it takes to be a top tier dramatic actor as he arguably delivers a career-high performance.Now for people contemplating whether or not they should see the film because Eggers' films so far have been "too artsy" and "not for the general audience" should put their worries aside and purchase their tickets because there isn't much to worry about even though there will be many classic Eggers shots he is typically known for.As for the small negatives about the film; I felt disappointed in how little we got of Dafoe as he often shines with these types of directors. I do also have to say that the movie isn't exactly how it is shown in the trailers (less action in the final product), some people claim the trailers are superior and even though I enjoyed my time in the cinema I slightly agree with those claims.
good This review's headline is facetious. But it's pretty much the same CONAN story you've seen before (and *that* lifted from both Shakespeare with some Norse mythology mixed in). But this time it's done under some fine direction with absolutely stunning cinematography. Fans of this stuff will love it and I'm sure metalheads into "Viking Metal" are going to go berserk over this.Loved the brief Dafoe cameo, as well as his "appearance" later on in the film.It's a blast.
good Brutal, dirty and a bit monotonous. The film is reminiscent of Valhalla Rising in its direct and merciless brutality - In which Mads Mikkelsen gives a facelift in a similarly harsh world of animal violence.A similar picture is drawn in Robert Egger's film, in a simple yet banal revenge story. Yes, the violence of the first part of the film is gripping. And yes, the whole thing is excellently implemented. Very different from Vikings pop cinema or some other Viking cinema. But in the end, violence alone is not enough to tell a good story. The director did better in his two previous films. But it remains a bloody and visually stunning spectacle that you should have seen.
good From the cast to the epic score, this is a movie to remember and rewatch over and over again.What a wonderful piece of cinema, very rare to witness this days.From Skarsgard to Anya, from Nicol to Claes, everyone was spot on the acting, presence and charisma necessary to carry this masterpiece over the top among the competition, with a special mention to Daffoe and Hawke's incredible moments.It's a movie made with a fine taste for ancient viking culture, with a simple story done in such an epic way.The fight scenes, the mysticism of it all, left me wanting more after it finished.The music score was perfect from beginning to the end, giving such a mood I haven't heard since Conan the Barbarian.The Icelanding landscapes were beautifuly shot, it's a movie or rare beauty and yet so violent and brutal, as the Sagas of old.A lesson to other producers, you don't need over the top CGI effects or to mix every race on a misplaced time, to make a good movie.Done with respect to the norsemen culture, with some understandable liberties here and there, but never losing ground on what a good Viking/Norse movie should be and never I saw a berserker so wonderfully portrayed - Alexander deserves an oscar right there, right now.The fight scenes were brutal, many were shot in a very close and detailed way in one take shots, reminding me of the masterpiece of Gibson's "Apocalypto" camera work. The final battle was one of the most epic fighting scenes, since the duel in Troy.All in all, an epic masterpiece not to be missed, but not for the faint of heart, this is a brutal story, told in such a beautiful way, with a good balance between reality and myth, between Hamlet and Beowulf (you will see what I mean).Praise Odin, this is pure Epic.
good Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ», is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!
good It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.
good Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.
good This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).
good Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.
good Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.
good Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was "a woman tries to do her taxes," and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.Believe the hype.Go in knowing as little as possible.See this movie.
good If you get weirded out just stay through til the end. It's worth it I promise. Thanks everyone who helped this movie be made. In a time when there's so many remakes and more of the same this is a wonderful original movie. Enjoy it.
good If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.
good Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as "Daniels", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the "normal" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as "Big Nose", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.
good I dont often give a film 10 stars, but this was superb. It was an intense and bizarre ride, with the strange concepts stretching so far out there at times, it was as though they made more sense. It was visually stunning, the costumes were epic, and the balance of humor and emotion was perfect. LOVED IT. No one else was meant for this role other than Michelle Yeoh. She brought the lead to life in the most beautiful, meaningful, perfect way. This whole movie was mind blowing.
good This might seem like a weird thing to start off with but, the editing in this movie was really well done. For a movie like this, the editing needs to be clean in order to properly follow the story and the editing team succeeded in this task. The use of parallel editing in this movie was cleverly done and worked flawlessly with the story especially when a match cut was also used. The story for this movie as well is a unique one that makes you think one thing but then becomes something else. The main story for this movie just seems like any other action/sci-fi movie with there being a chosen one who's the only one that can save the universe but underneath that is a deeper story. The deeper story is really what hooks the audience for this wild and wacky ride of a movie as it's one everybody can relate to. What I really liked about this story though was how it easily mashed everything together from the comedy to the more serious moments and the action scenes. Another thing about the writing for this movie is how something will be mentioned and just seem like a throwaway thing but then come back in some way. This is a testament to the writers and directors of this movie Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. This movie is a weird and wacky ride and the directing duo understood that and dived headfirst into it which is what makes this movie a unique and memorable one. What also helps in that department is the acting in this movie and man did everybody deliver for this movie. Everybody in this movie had to juggle between being serious and comedic and nailed it. Michelle Yeoh was the stand-out performance for me and I just want to know how she was able to stay in character during some of the scenes in this movie. The final thing I want to talk about with this movie is the lighting in this movie and how well it was used. The lighting in this movie, along with the screen ratio, helps the audience figure out which universe it is. In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a wild and wacky ride that has a meaningful message along with it that you need to see.
good "Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on."Just a brilliant film, pulling off a wonderfully creative mix of genres and delivering powerful messages at the end. Packed as it is with little references and action, this one would be a good one to re-watch. Loads of fun.
good Non stop action and laughs the whole way through. Everything Everywhere All At Once is the movie that you need to see if you want a great cinematic experience. In my opinion I think this is as good possible better than No Way Home. I loved the acting in this as well.The way that the directors filmed this movie was also genius. The whole concept of the film was brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis was also phenomenal as always. This film was just absolutely stunning to watch and to look at. Easily one of the best films of the year so far.
good Leaving the movie theatre, I can barely comprehend the thoughts swirling around in my head right now. From the intriguing trailer, you wouldn't even begin to fathom the existential depths this movie submerges you under. Only to bring you back to the surface gasping for air just when things are at their bleakest. The directorial choices are the sign of geniuses at work, the acting and cinematography and editing really show that mastery plus effort leaves the roof smashed off the place Everything Everywhere All At Once is perfection in all these regards.You know it's special when you leave the movie feeling like it was made just for you. Daniels accomplished just that with this work of art coming to me right exactly when I needed it. The themes of family, fulfillment, love, and everything in between hit resoundingly close to home. I'm so glad I got to experience this even if it doesn't win any Oscars which it absolutely ought to. If critics don't carry this little picture on all their best of lists I don't know what to do. The picture itself, Michelle Yeoh in Actress, Stephanie Hsu in Supporting Actress, Ke Huy Quan in Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, Directing, Editing, Costumes, Visual Effects, Score., Sound, Academy please consider Everything Everywhere All At Once. I know it's a challenge given the absurdity of some of the plot beats of the film but when you boil it down it's a very heartwarming and affecting piece of cinema.
good Everything Everywhere All at Once is stunning. It's a corky spectacle, but remains deeply vulnerable. The narrative follows Evelyn, whose business and personal relationships are failing. Plus, Evelyn is unexpectedly tasked with saving the entire multiverse as her personal life bursts. This story might sound familiar, but it develops into an unparalleled blend of comedy, action, adventure, and drama. Each role is compelling, the conflict is relatable, the arcs are earned, and the plot devices are utilized to their fullest. Furthermore, the entire cast displays a wide range of skills: switching characters, blending tones, and striking beats in a symphony of emotions.Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once is masterfully crafted. Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is marvelous because it fuses so much into a cohesive experience. In other hands, it would be a mess, but Everything Everywhere All at Once works beautifully.Writing: 9/10
good An instant classic, on par with the first Matrix film, EEAAO is a genre-bending masterpiece, equally parts funny, intense and emotional.The basic plot follows Evelyn, a middle aged Chinese woman who develops the ability to share the skills and memories of alternate versions of herself across the multiverse in order to save it.It is FAR deeper than that, and I wish I could go all spoilers, but I saw it early so I'll say this much, it is far more accessible than Swiss Army Man (which is still a great movie in my eyes) and I think many people will find much value in this film.I will say that the audience I watched the movie with was the most excited and active audience I've watched a movie with since Spider-Man No Way Home. A completely original film with no nostalgia bait, getting several cheers, laughs and applauses. Not to mention the few times I got close to crying.10/10 a must see.
good Michelle Yeoh owns a failing laundromat with her nebbishy husband Ke Huy Quan, who has just served her with divorce papers. They are being audited by IRS agent Jamie Lee Curtis. Her father, James Hong, threw her out when she married, and is now her wheelchair-bound dependent. Her daughter, Stephanie Hsu, has a girlfriend, which she cannot explain to her father. Then, during a terrible session with Miss Curtis, Quan takes off his glasses and in an authoritative voice tells her that only she can save the multiverse; from this reality defined by all the bad choices ever made, she must tap the abilities of the versions of herself who are more successful than she is; this means every one of them. She is the worst version of herself. Naturally, she is confused, particularly when she discovers that the ultimate evil that threatens all realities is her daughter.It certainly gives Miss Yeoh a chance to stretch her acting muscles and the editing is wonderful. This sort of story is an enjoyable "wheels of time" story, and tackles the nihilism at the heart of the subgenre: if every decision you make was decided differently in another universe, what difference does it make?My cousin enjoyed most of it but thought the ending sentimental. I thought the sentimental ending was appropriate. What a pity the industry hasn't made better use of Miss Yeoh!
good An Asian woman in a middle age crisis suddenly is informed that there is a MULTIVERSE and she is the only who can save from total distraction.From there; everything is absolute madness, violence and many humorous situations for a trip of almost two and half hour.No, is not SPIDERMAN and even the SCI-FI suddenly becomes more of a metaphor. It is never boring (perhaps a little too long) but everything that happens becomes absolutely logic by the end.Michelle Yeoh is excellent and I hope she at least get a nomination. Jamie Lee Curtis also very good as always. The rest of the cast is on the same level.It is not worth to explain more; but you have to see it to believe it.
good 2022 is not even halfway over, but I saw Everything, Everywhere last night, and I simply cannot imagine it not being the best film of 2022.To say I was stunned is an understatement. I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I've watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.Last night's screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It's hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It's the fiercest performance I've seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I've seen in years.As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.I don't rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.And at the end of the day, maybe that's everything.
good Wow, what a movie. Being able to be so wacky yet so profound is difficult, but this movie is able to to do it all at once(no pun intended)! The main characters exploration of her relationships with her father, husband, and especially her daughter ground the movie, but it's willingness to turn the mundane what if scenarios that we make up in our heads into plot points is truly something special. While it drags on just a tad near the end, this movie is a must watch, and expect it to get some Oscar nods this coming year.
good What makes this film exciting is not its premise, but its execution. Each scene demonstrates the creativity and silliness of the filmmakers, as well as the talent of the actors to pull off such caricatures. The cherry on top is the beautiful message of the film; it somehow grabs you and doesn't let go.
good If the Jet Li movie The One was written by Monty Python you'd get a film very much like this.It's pretty fun, even if the character development is sporadic rather than occurring over time which can be a bit jarring, but over all its pretty entertaining.
good Im quitting film school because I can't ever do something better. I mean it. That was exception on so many levels. What an amazing story. Please see this movie.
bad This is the dumbest film i have ever seen. If you don't believe me, plunk down your money and see for yourself. The fascinating thing is that you stick around just to see what stupid thing happens next. The real problem is jake. He's just not the bad guy type. How many cop cars does it take to stop an ambulance? A lot more than you think.
bad Michael Bay has made more rubbish films than good. The studios should stop giving him ridiculous budgets because he's just gonna spend it on smashing up as many vehicles as the budget will allow, regardless of trying to entertain the audience with anything resembling a decent film.All 3 of us hated it.1/10.
bad Once you get through the entry setup it quickly jumps right into the bank heist. The are portrayed as clueless, yet the Boss Jake has loads of expensive toys from his successful robbing career.The robbery is super simple, and it's over in 10 mins. The rest of the movie, the remaining 2 hours, is the chase. Each bag has 8Mil in 100s, which weighs 176 pounds. Both actors carry them around like they are empty. The constant erratic unstable camera work will give you a head ache, needless and annoying.Tons of character issues. The female paramedic fleeing the ambulance with a person in critical condition. Armed gunman refuse to leave an ambulance and stays in an emergency vehicle. Lead investigator is gay and in marriage counseling at the time he gets a call. Lead cop calls off a 15 car police chase cause his dog is in one of the cars?? Wtf. Jake is making calls and arguing about party favors.And of course it has to get even more outrageous. Lets try open chest surgery in the back of a moving ambulance rocking down the highway. More unnecessary shaky camera work. Phone battery dies.So the same hero EMT who flees, jumps into the line of fire to prevent the group from being shot. Just so many terrible character decisions. Two brothers get into a front seat fight while driving. Ugh. Let's spray paint an
bad Dumb, dumber, and even more dumber! Ambulance is one those thrill rides you watch for the thrill for the first time. Years latter or the second time you watch Ambulance and says this is so stupid. Ambulance is a mix of the movie Heat and Speed all in one. There is the Woke characters, and the brothers from different mothers theme which is shows Hollywood is dying from running out of ideas. There is a bank robbery turned into a Ambulance jack. With chases with Ambulance surgery done online by an E M T. After that a drug cartel workout with a plan of several Ambulance as an escape plan. This over top attempts tires to over come flat characters from the usual Hollywood stereotypes. Drug cartels guys, tough E M T women, the army vet black guy trying help his family, which has the same old just done over and over in so many different ways. In spite of this a thrill ride which is fun to watch for first time, Ambulance is a desperate attempt to re do another Lethal Weapon, Taken, and Die Hard type movie. So over the top it's different, but the usual flat characters mixed with little story makes this a B movie. 3 stars.
bad First, you go for a bank robbery to get 16 millions, you split in four bags, and then in one bag you have 8 millions. Magical.Second, a medical surgeon that earns 7 digits eats 1$ microwave frozen chicken during his lunch time. Real.Last, the movie is just a long commercial of Cheetos, Keruig and Lean Cuisine... Are you serious?So, this is Dumbulance. Hollywood is brain dead.
bad I lasted for 60 minutes.This film was literally like being on a rollercoaster. I've never witnessed such horrendous filming. Impossible to follow due to constant and unrelenting sweeping and changing angles. I didn't know what was happening. I felt SO sick I had to leave.There was zero story within the first 60 minutes before I left.Vue kindly gave me a refund.Avoid at all costs.Who makes these films? There were two people in the theatre so this will bomb, as it deserves to.
bad What should be a fun action flick becomes literally unwatchable as the overuse of shaky cam causes even more headaches and eye rolls than a plot with holes big enough to drive an ambulance through.
bad The only director that can have a thousand insane things happening on screen at the same time and still the movie is boring and dull, story is stupid and plot is nonsensical and probably the worst melodramatic music ever.Another Bay another dud.
ok Lately, Jake Gyllenhaal had been tackling very high-strung excitable characters, like supervillain Mysterio in "Spider-Man: Far from Home" (2019) and the troubled 911 operator in "The Guilty" (2021). His character Danny Sharp here was really a scary, crazy guy who simply snapped as things did not go his way on this particular day, when his perfectly-laid plans miscarried and was unraveling in the worst possible way.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II turned heads as the charismatic Black Panther head Bobby Seale in "The Trial of the Chicago 7" (2020). His William Sharp is a considerably more vulnerable character -- a man driven to crime by sheer desperation. In her biggest role since her breakthrough in "Baby Driver" (2017), Eiza Gonzalez's fearless EMT Cam is quite attention-getting, especially for her "successful" surgery using her hair clip as a vascular clamp.This remake of a 2005 Danish film was one big, over-the-top, exaggerated hyperbole, a Bay trademark. To add more chaos, he made sure that the ambulance had fruits or flowers or dresses to hit and scatter around. The camera was in constant dizzying motion, coming in and out from various angles. Running at a hefty 136 minutes, the whole thing felt bloated and can actually be tiresome to watch with all the medical absurdities and manic energy it had.
bad I made it 20 minutes and turned this hunk of crap off. This director needs to go away and retire. His movies have been garbage since like 2000. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
bad I had a really hard time convincing myself to stay and finish this movie when I saw it. The story & plot itself is silly, which I expected based on the trailers and how paper thin the setup is but visually this was headache inducing.The basic plot of this movie is that Jake Gyllenhall & Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are brothers who go on a bank heist that goes wrong. The crew they rob the bank with gets picked off one by one by the LAPD until something goes sideways as the brothers try to make their escape. Due to an unfortunate mishap, both brothers are forced to commandeer an ambulance and make a run for it. One long car chase ensues with lots of crashes, screeching tires, bullets flying and explosions.Again, this is fine because I expected it from the trailers. Also it's a Michael Bay directed film, so I expected it to be mostly style over substance and spectacle.Unfortunately the movie is visually shot with non-stop shaky cam & drone-like aerial and swirling shots. And I mean NON-STOP. It's like Michael Bay & his cinematographer shot gunned a 6-pack of Red Bull, snorted a Ziploc full of cocaine, busted out a smartphone and turned off all visual stabilization and started shooting while running.There are almost no shots where the camera isn't swooping up or down or rotating around people or things and shaking like crazy. It made it difficult to follow the action. Even in an early scene where Jake & Yahya's characters are talking, the camera is constantly revolving around them!Perhaps if Michael Bay controlled himself & shot this movie in a way where it was easier to follow the action and the camera wasn't constantly moving, I'd like this a lot more. Nothing could be more mind numbing or boring than watching a camera shake or move all over the place for nearly 90 minutes! I get that some of things being done visually are the director's trademarks but it's dialed up to 11 and just non-stop.I wouldn't recommend paying to watch this unless you absolutely have nothing better to do. The story is too silly and visually this movie is too much of a mess to be entertaining in my humble opinion. Go watch Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Morbius instead...
ok Remake of a Danish comedy in an attempt to make an action movie where the only good thing is the performance of all its actors.The director in his terrible line of not allowing the film to breathe without any break. The camera totally crazy shaking everywhere and getting to produce serious dizziness.
bad Couldn't even get through this ridiculous, silly mess of a movie. No idea what Jake was thinking? I hope they paid him really well to star in this trash.Don't waste your time. And if you do, at least you were warned.
bad Just less than half an hour in I'm already filled with nausea. Don't you guys have stuntmen? The camera works is worse than someone falling down a cliff and filming. Horrible!0 star!2 star for Jake Gyllenhaal
bad star for the storythat's it. Never again Michael Bay's movie. Horrible!
bad Don't expect anything really new (or, for the most part, exciting or accurate) from Michael Bay. This movie is no exception to that.Like his many other movies, the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. It's mainly an excuse to wreck as many vehicle as possible and kill as many people as you can allow on film.Don't expect "character development," either. There are snippets that seem to be thrown is to give an excuse for making this movie. A wife needs an "experimental operation" that insurance won't pay for. A rookie cop is careless as his partner seeks revenge on those who injure him. An EMT was a 3rd year resident in medicine, but had to quit because she used "speed" and had to quit. That last one was especially disturbing since she completely forgot anything of human anatomy.The saddest things about this film are that Jake Gyllenhaal, a gifted actor, is reduced to playing a crazy stereotype in the last half of the movie, and Garret Dillahunt, an actor who has given a slew of amazing television performances, is reduced to playing a cop who leads probably the most incompetent undercover team of the LAPD.The one actor who DOES give a decent, nuanced performance, is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Unfortunately, his role is the yin to Gyllenhaal's yang: the good brother who's caught up in crazy brother's insane plot to steal money (because it's there, I guess) and who accidentally shoots a police office who is carried off in the ambulance, and later gets hijacked.ZZZZzzzzzz.
ok So another Jake Gyllenhaal remake of a Scandinavian movie. This one a lot older than the phone only movie that was released last year. Therefor I couldn't remember much of the original, but it didn't actually matter ... because this is completely different from the original movie ... this is as out there as it can be. It has been turned into a Bay movie ... the premise more or less is the same. Even there have been tweaks (the brothers, the dynamic, why they do ... what they do ... where they go and so much more) ... so much that you can't really recognize the original movie anymore.This turns it up to 11 to say the least ... the action part. There is even a Heat like shootout - not as good as the one Michael Mann did, but close enough (I don't do cigars, in case you were wondering). There are many action and stunt scenes then ... but also a lot more comedy it feels like ... at least the "bad" brother seems way more relatable than I remember him being in the original. Doesn't mean he is without flaws ... and craziness ... but Jake plays him with such charisma that you can't help but root for him too.It's all fun and games then ... well until the last third of the movie. And it reminded me a bit of the switch Bad Boys 2 took ... it was such a fun movie ... and then it went ... I think ballistic is the right term to use. Anyway it got way too serious .. and same is true here. It is really a shame ... morals and cliches and all ... not sure how one was supposed to end this .. but the added elements and characters would have given some opportunities for different approaches and turns ... anyway, it is what it is ... and while I was almost going to give it an 8 (if it remained "fun" - as in the term Popcorn movie was invented just for this), but was also thinking going as low as 6 ... guess a 7 is ok, even if purists may dislike I gave it the same rating that I did the original. Be aware of what you are watching and suspend your disbelief ... or if you are not a fan of Bay do not watch this at all.
bad I'm not a fan of Bay Movies. I liked Bad Boys, and the Rock, but it became very apparent very quickly that his directing style is one-note and formulaic; shakey-cams inside stationary vehicles, slowly undulating American flags, incomprehensible editing choices, disjointed voice bites, and shouting = comedy. Not to mention the man had never locked down a camera in his life.Now throw HD camera drones into the mix and now there's a whole new mess of terrible gimmick over-saturation.This story did not need to be told by Michael Bay, because he destroyed it. There's something there, but the film is put together so abysmally that you end up not caring about any of the characters, you just want the trainwreck to end.,
bad I should have known what to expect with a Michael Bay film. But this was just ridiculous. So many plot holes and character decisions that just made no sense whatsoever. Example...they enter a seemingly deserted bank via an underground parking lot (that's just holding $32 million in cash on a table) and the plan is to walk out the front door onto the Main Street with bags of money on their backs, despite them already realising there is a policeman outside. This is just one example, but there are dozens.Absolutely terrible.
bad Why Why Why..... it's not clever, it makes the audience feel like vomiting!This movie was actually quite good, if it wasn't for the absolutely horrendous shaky/zoom in/out camerawork!Please stop it, we hate it!!!
bad The story is about a bank robbery similar to the one in Heat " the movie". However the storyline and the acting level are struggling behind and everything seems to be fake and can't convince a 6 years old kid!.The movie is all about a mighty power ambulance vehicle that has been robbed by two thieves while trying to escape from the police after the bank robbery, and the police with all their helicopters, snipers, dodge cars and thousands of bullets can't stop the ambulance !, this ambulance vehicle is equivalent to the mighty train we all saw in GTA IV, no matter how many stars are chasing you..the train is
ok At first I was like there something off.Lets divide the movie into 3 parts:-1st: The director Micheal Bay it appears he just bought a drone and he wanna use it. So many scenes with the drone he go up, down, left, right and in zig zig. To the extent my eyes hurt and I felt nauseous.2nd: he bank haist it's so messy to the extent there is no plan. Why is he drop at first down? And pick them up from the front door. Why they are going to the haist without any masks. Why they are going to haist without plan!! It was like hey brother nice to see you we were just about to make the biggest haist in history!!!3rd: the Ending Whyyyyyy... whyyy is she going the thro patient files!! Why is she visiting a patient while she is filled with blood! And the police man was like this one save me!! Don't you remember he is the one shot you at firstjake gyllenhaal acting is the only good thing in this movie.
ok I was expecting a mindless action movie, but a fun one with a big smile on my face. Instead I got a slideshow with cuts every other second. I haven't been invested in the movie, didn't care about the brothers, not the paramedic, nor the police officers getting them. There was no continous or fluid action scene so we'll be able to understand or have a slight idea of what's happening on screen. We just got 10 cuts per second, so my brain was overwhelmed with non sense information.Somewhere underneath this crap, there is a good movie... Maybe.
bad ...just bad. I was laughing my ass off at the movie for roughly the first half. It was just so ridiculous. Then it started taking itself too seriously, characters got killed off or forgotten about. It was just a mess.You don't think that you'd ever say that Michael bay is losing it, you know, because he never really had it to begin with. But man, it just stopped being funny even to laugh at and I started thinking that Mr. Bay might have a brain tumor or something.I hope all is well with you Mr. Bay.
bad I can not believe the one who made Armageddon rock Pearl Harbor twenty-five to fifteen years ago, made such a .... movie. For God's sake, do not make a film when there is no script. The whole story is absurd. A big orchestra for a small childish script.
ok Warning: this film can seriously damage your brain.The beginning of the film was ok and showed no red flags.Then grown men started talking like saucy 15-year-olds, and I got that feeling...like I've heard this before. Checked the director - Bay.Bingo.Then everything made perfect sense. Thirty-minute-long actions scenes with insane camera work - check. Surreal decision-making in a world that operates in Grand Theft Auto V logic - check. Blatant mockery of politically relevant topics - check.I can enjoy a Bay film, I love the Rock, and it's very similar. But this one is of complete insanity. It's so incredibly over the top you can't even see the top from here.And then Bay tries to do drama, and of course, it's excruciating.There's no reason to try to understand the story since it exists only in this nightmare world where everyone is aggressive, careless, stupid, and has no regard for their or others' lives.Pros: some decent action scenes and excellent acting by Gyllenhaal.Cons: it's a nightmare.Overall, it's a solid live adaptation of a GTA V five-star car chase but with no tanks.
ok Beast because many had expectation they were disappointed.Movie seems to attract children and Family. It was not boring as reviewed by many. Vijay has that charm that no one can break it with reviews nor point out his remuneration etc. Comedy was good, music and dance was excellent. Editor Nirmal has done justice. Overall a good movie.
bad I had high expectations from this film but the film didn't work on any level the comedy fall flat. To be fair the film did start well but at the end of it i wanted my money backThe problem with Beast is that it has a protagonist who is too strong given a mission that never seems to be a challenge. The terrorists hardly seem dangerous.The film is bogged down by the lack of inventiveness. There is no powerful villain to take on Vijay and make the proceedings interesting. It is Vijay's show all the way and he headlines this clichÃ©d thriller.Without a doubt this is one of the most sillyist film Vijay has done very terrible film.
bad Beast (2022) :
ok Nothing new in the story..but the treatment is a bit fresh.Screenplay is uninteresting.Some comedy scenes are good some are bad.Action episodes are good.Some serious scenes are silly.Vijay is at his best.Pooja is...u know..Songs and BGM are good.Cinematography and Production design are decent.Special mention-Editing is very good.This is not a very good movie but you can watch as weekend time pass..
bad If you are hard-core vijay fan then its OK otherwise skip this movie. Screenplay & direction is very slow and boring. Beast is hyperly hyped headache movie. Over elevation & action.*Typical story line ( indian raw agent in action)
bad This movie is action without any proper story line and script. Already 100 of hollywood movie and web series came with same story line. If you are Vijay fan then you may like otherwise nothing to watch. Very disappointed by nelson.
good An ex RAW agent gets into the mission to save people at the hijacked mall.It was a good family entertainment film. Vijay is the one who completely steal the show. The presence of Vijay in each and every frame made the audience ecstatic. However the story line loss it's uniqueness the screenplay made it non boring but quite guessable. And also this film was completely logicless.Other artists, due to the lack of importance on their role in this film get wasted.Unlike the director's previous films, in Beast his touch completely fades though he tried to impose it.The editing was crisp and he didn't made the audience gets bored. He did his job well.And also the cinematography was impressive.The bgm really gives goosebumps but some score felt like 'heard somewhere' and also from the music director's previous films.Art department works were so good and they really gave their hard work in each and every scenes. VFX felt ok.Finally a good entertainment film though there's lot of flaws. All set of audiences enjoyed in the theatre. Especially family audience can definitely enjoy it. And also a treat for Vijay fans.
bad Predictable script ,no freshness, some action and comedy with no logic, cringy dialogues. I can't force anyone to not to watch this film its upon you.
bad During pandemic times, viewers pay hard earned money to see the movie and net result being dissatisfied, more so for the S. Indian diaspora. Everyone who has watched this on screen contributes to the 100 crores hero's salary and his future higher remuneration.The movie is a cherry picked and nit picked string of context from various English movies and European serials, stitched together.From the word get go, Eye in the Sky is plagiarised for the first 20 minutes. The mall take over, brings in line with Money Heist. Ending dog fight is a mix of Tom Cruise Top Gun and Arnold Schwarzenegger's True Lies. The middle portion of the movie is Die Hard, Bruce Willis, along with Sylvester Stallone Rambo killing style.Nelson has biten more than he can chew. At the end of the day it's a hefty pay package for Vijay and Nelson. Sun pictures perhaps can write off losses and / or, launder clean money.Yogi Babu and Redin, roles absolutely pointless.Nothing connects.Nelson would be a more critically acclaimed director if he follows his creativity than plug himself a square box into the circle of Vijay.It is better than Valimai, maybe.When you have absolutely nothing to do, if you are watching paint dry or grass grow, then watch this movie on OTT.You have not lost nor missed out on anything by giving this a miss.
good Movie is good, no more boring, Some idiots talking negative, Vijay is one man army. This movie comedy and Action movie no sentiments in this movie that's it, interesting but some thing is missing, any way don't blame the movie is waste, movie is good ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ i like it. Some of them are saying that comparison with kgf2, don't with that, because kgf movie is a history the real story, Beast is a entertainment movie, kgf action and sentiments, no more comedy in that movie many people are comparing with kgf2, one thing I can say that kgf is no 1 movie, and Beast no 2 movie. Understand properly and don't talk as a rubbishly.
bad Very illogical story line also a very small story line with that movie falls accordingly. Aniruth does an aniruth again. He solely manage to bring out the best in him. But that too went in vein as there is no gripping story or screenplay or characters and all. Vijay is swaggy and damn smart but that didnt add much to the film as it is pointless. Nelson's datk comedy where? I thought he could however manage the film with his dark humor but that is totally missing and deeply disappointing. Overall its not even a celebrating occasions even for Vijay fans. Thats the worst case scenario here.
bad Beast has nothing new and Vijay is doing same type of role in his all movies,movie is slow and boring. Any thing happens any where. And trying to show wrong image of raw and home minister. Only Vijay character is good and waste of side actor and Pooja also.
good It's not so bad as others say in reviews.. Story is pretty good May be the screenplay messed slightly.. Vijay was great i his dance .. Definitely can be watched with families .. Without any expectations the movie won't feel boring that is for sureMy rating would be Average or even slightly better than average .. Not very bad by any means.. I am not able to cook half star from my iPhone3.2 out of 5Price could have been 15$ instead of 20$ plus 3.29 in taxes.
ok Vijay makes 300crores box office movies every year with ease and this may also become one of those following the success of Master but overall for fans and as a movie it's a letdown.Movie lacks Drama, Plot, Purpose and A Good Ending.With the trailer it was very clear that 70-80% movie is going to be in Mall setting only. Nothing wrong Die Hard and Speed have done it in restricted setting but this movie had no drama and story spine to elevate audience interest to what's coming next.Whole movie is a treat for Anirudh fans and slow mo lovers.Cinematography is by far the best for 2022
good Different type of vijay film, Vijay played his role well,especially anirudh scored with his bgmðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. Stund scenes are extraordinary ðŸ”¥Overall a Good film.
bad Nothing in that Film , worst screenplay, and Nelson disappointed to all.. Then vijay action is very low.So Many scene Logically is impossible.Vijay Climax scene Playing video game.
bad As the director arrogantly said in an interview hes in this field to make money not make good movies. India has a much more mature audience now, make good movies or at least attempt to or find another profession.
ok Really disappointed, everything seems to be okay but the problem is, Why did Vijay choose this movie.Vijay gotta be more serious about selecting scripts, how can such a big star choose an unrealistic film.Despite good comedy elements, this film has nothing to talk about.I'm ashamed, this film was suppose to represent Tamil cinema!
ok A cliched, Vijay version of Die Hard with some inspiration from Money Heist set in a nonsensical comical world where the protagonist and everything he does, doesn't fit into. It seems that the director has his way of creating his world of characters who can be smart and dumb at the same time. But being a Vijay movie, the star only has a few ways that could be acceptable to his fans. On top of that action scenes which are just enough to take you out of the immersion and feel weird and the placement of songs like it was 15 years ago make it hard all around for this movie. There is a lot of stuff in the movie that could have just worked if they tweaked it a little bit. It's still a one time watch for fans of these types of action films.
bad Look at Nelson previous filmography, he made absolute content oriented films with stellar storyline and his films never overshadowed by the popularity of the star. But Vijay being vijay,made complete movie about him and made it a one man show and same with Nelson he made the film according to vijay mass image completely changing his original film making style. Worst movie please avoid.
bad This movie is a disaster. Zero logic, physics-dedying stunts, cringe-worthy stunts, nineteenth century storyline, and lack of good humour (VTV Ganesh comedy is not enjoyable). Overall this movie is a torture. Avoid this movie!!! Wait for Thalapathy-66.
ok Although I was always on the fence about how good a director Nelson Dilipkumar was, some endearing elements of his earlier ventures like "Kolamaavu Kokila (2018)" and "Doctor (2021)" included his ability to churn out humour in the most unexpected of circumstances as well as his attention to detail when it came to his character sketches. His latest release "Beast", however, falters on both fronts while also failing to provide adequate mass elevation scenes and fan service to even render it appreciable for Vijay aficionados.As the teasers and trailer mostly gave away, Vijay stars as "Veera Raghavan", a former intelligence operator who gets stuck in a mall Die Hard style while the establishment is run over by a gang of armed terrorists. How he uses his fists and wits to battle his way out of the seemingly intractable crisis and rescue the civilians trapped inside forms the rest of this cliched plotline. While one can forgive the predictability in the storyline, the superficial nature of the supporting cast makes the entire movie-watching experience go for a toss, with the antagonists especially reduced to mere caricatures, with no depth or character arcs to speak of.And the comedy that Nelson has made his hallmark fails to take off. While some one-liners from veteran VTV Ganesh manage to evoke some laughs, the normally dependable Yogi Babu and Redin Kingsley are given precious little creative dialogues to work with. The female protagonists-Pooja Hegde and Aparna Das, as with all recent Vijay movies, reduce to mere also-there tropes. It was particularly painful to watch Shine Tom Chacko, a character actor who won the admiration of millions of fans across the nation with his powerful performances in "Kurup (2021)" and "Bheeshma Parvam (2022)" reduced to such a lame-duck side role.Stunt sequences in superstar movies have always bordered on the implausible to the downright impossible but where Beast falters is in trying to also add quirkiness, the believability factor is reduced to nought as a whole while raising the cringe factor to full. With clear 'inspiration' taken from "Money Heist", at no point does any of the action choreography manage to wow you or catch you by surprise, despite having a superstar of Vijay's natural charisma and dexterity at their disposal.Vijay's calculus in trying to broaden his appeal by imbibing Nelson's characteristic wit and humour into his superstar image with "Beast" was, unfortunately, undone by unimaginative, derivative stunt sequences as well as a string of poorly written, underdeveloped supporting characters. Nelson clearly had to sacrifice his natural storytelling style to accommodate the 'superstar' persona of his lead actor and in forcibly making Vijay dominate every sequence, the narrative strength and emotional impact of the storyline clearly suffered.A disastrous, over-the-top, cringe-pro-max ultra-final act will render you speechless (in a bad way) and run screaming out of the theatre. Ultimately, we experienced the best parts of "Beast" even before the film's theatre release-its two superb songs "Arabic Kuthu" and "Jolly O Gymkhana" and its kickass BGM. This movie is one dumpster fire you would want to avoid at all costs. Not recommended!
bad I love the way Vijay character has been portrayed and he looks too good, that's the only plus of this movie.First Half of the movie was good because of the comedy. Too many comedians, but not much role given to Yogi Babu, Kingsley and other few cast from doctor. Pooja Hegde is totally waste in this movie.BGM is good and as usual for Fans they have shown Vijay as Mass.However, it didn't meet the expectations especially the climax. Introduction of Vijay was disappointing, there was no logic at all. Graphic designing is too bad. Nelson haven't knew what is a role of a Raw Agent, poor script. I can't how he made such movie after "Doctor". Definitely not worth.
bad Beast had a high expectation due to Nelson's previous movies were hit in the box office.Vijay was totally wasted in a very dull script.Apart from Vijay and Aniruth's Bgm film has no plus points.Vijay tried his best to save this sinking ship.
bad As boring, as uninteresting, as sloppy a movie can get ! It still has a couple of moments but not good enough to salvage the movie. Staring at a wall for more than 3 hours is still a better option.
ok A mixed-bag Hollywood comedy, suffering from the usual complaint which is that all the best scenes are in the trailer. This one offers a broad satire of filmmaking in the COVID era, with a lot of lockdowns, bubbles and hygiene-following. A sprawling ensemble cast are efficient in their roles, some funnier than others, but sadly the wit tends to be bypassed in favour of dumber sex or vomit gags. I did enjoy the dancing scenes and the CGI jokes, however.
bad Oh no, this is very bad.I've enjoyed most of the other Judd Apatow films I've seen, and I really like some of the tv shows he's written for including Freaks and Geeks, Love, and Girls (I know some people hate that last one but I like it, sue me).In telling the story of a troubled film production occurring during the pandemic, there's potential here, plus a lot of the cast have been funny in other films before. Movies about difficult or unconventional film shoots are often very entertaining, too.... but this won't join the ranks of Ed Wood, Be Kind Rewind, Living In Oblivion, The Disaster Artist, or Dolemite Is My Name; not by a long shot (if The Bubble looks intriguing to you, just watch any of those films instead. They're all much better).This and a few COVID-era stand up specials (most notably Aziz Ansari's latest middling half-hour special) have shown that to make COVID funny, you have to make something really good, clever, or creative. It's becoming apparent that it's a hard subject to make funny. I don't think it's impossible to laugh at parts of it, but given its so recent and so many of us are still living through it, bad to average COVID-themed humour lands with more of a dull thud than bad to average regular humour.Plus, it doesn't help that a lot of the jokes here that aren't particularly relevant to the pandemic are pretty toothless and boring. The banter just isn't funny- the semi-improvised sounding types of conversations that were funny in Apatow's The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up just aren't funny here.I smiled a little a couple of times, but when your comedy's over a couple of hours long, that's just not enough. I checked the time at point, thinking I was a over halfway done, and I was less than 40 minutes in. I checked it again when I felt like there was half an hour left, and there was still 65 minutes to go.It's not good. And it uses a terrible Miley Cyrus cover of Heart of Glass at one point, which was a bit offensive.
ok Watched this film at Paris theater in NYC aka the Netflix Theater. Without spoiling much, I will just that this film is not very funny. Contrary, it's long, it's got too many characters, the storyline is very vague and confusing, and the jokes are not there. Judd Apatow was bragging about finishing the script in 8 weeks, and honestly it really felt so.
bad Not once did I laugh, at most I had about two 'slight chuckles'. None of the characters are interesting, there are two many, and the writing is sophomoric at best. It anything it gave a slight documentary of what film sets went through during the pandemic but other than that it does not serve a purpose.
ok Alright, let me break your bubble here.. I usually enjoy Judd Apatow's low-brow comedies, but this one reminds us of everything we hated about the early stages of the pandemic with added celebrity commentary. The humor didn't land for me most of the time, and even with a spectacular cast, the film never hits the highs you expect. It just gets by with a meandering screenplay that neither engages nor makes us root for any of its whiny, privileged characters. Well, Apatow's trying otherwise - he wants us to laugh at (and not with) everyone in the film industry dominated by corporate giants and larger-than-life characters. The pandemic was a bad phase, and no films needed to be made around that subject. Some fleeting flourishes aside (mostly from Pedro Pascal and a few cameos), The Bubble is honestly a letdown!
ok Don't get me wrong, I love a good joke. I just don't love the same joke being repeated over and over for two hours. There's plenty to mock over the past couple of years and I applaud this movie for having a go but it would've been much better if someone who actually understood comedy had written this, like Ricky Gervais or the Monty python crowd. But no. In typical Netflix fashion we get a corporate confection of mediocrity.
bad Premise had a lot of potential. The cast are talented. The film is just not very good. It's poorly paced and the gags are flat. Could've been great with a rewrite that included actual jokes and slicker dialogue.Not a good film by any measure.
ok Ignore the usual one score reviews. Same people basically stating it's the same as some of the worse movies in history. Pathetic. It's pretty funny. Easy viewing but if your looking for story and Oscar performances then obviously this ain't the film.Rest of you one scorers need to grow up a bit really. Your ruining the worth of the sites reviews.
ok Following the critical and box office failure of her vehicle, Jerusalem Uprising, Carol Cobb (Karen Gillan) returns to the dinosaur action franchise Cliff Beasts for the sixth installment. Due to the COVD pandemic production is set up in a "bubble" in England where Carol and the other actors will live together to prevent any infections. As producer Gavin (Peter Serafinowicz) impotently tries to rein in negative publicity, on set tensions, and vices of the cast, the initially planned three month shoot gets extended again and again.Cliff Beasts is the latest film from director Judd Apatow who also writes the film alongside Pam Brady best known for her work with South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker on the first three seasons of South Park, South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, as well as Team America: World Police. The COVD pandemic has inspired a number of films attempting to capitalize on the pandemic ranging from Steven Soderbergh's surprisingly good Kimi, to slapdash productions like Songbird and Locked, and bottom of the barrel schlock like Corona: Fear is a Virus or The Covid Killer, however comedies have yet to tap into the genre save for outliers like NBC's short lived Connected or Freeform's Love in the Time of Corona both of which didn't particularly resonate with audiences. I think because of the nature of the pandemic it's been difficult to put any sort of comedic spin on the material especially in regards to the real world insanity and stupidity that doesn't lend itself all that well to exaggeration. With a strong cast of comedians and noted creative forces behind the camera The Bubble is possibly the biggest COVD film we've seen yet and has the makings of something truly insightful, but at a little over two hours long and filled with abrasive characters The Bubble has some moments of humor but as a whole doesn't come together.Like other comedies that have attempted to approach the COVD pandemic, Apatow runs into the issue of having to create comic chaos in a place where everything is very controlled and structured and that rigidity ends up working against the talents of the cast as there's long sequences where they're forced to be by themselves or maybe with one other person and we really don't get the best environment for creating comic friction. Karen Gillan is our lead Carol Cobb and she's a fine actress with a strong repertoire of work, but her main gimmick is basically just taking very casual abuse from the cast, crew, and even her boyfriend who dumps her over video conferencing and continues to live in her house with a random waitress. The worst thing you can do in a comedy is make us feel sorry for the characters and that's what happens as we for the most part as we watch relationships deteriorate and egos clash and you feel like you're trapped with these people with no escape. Eventually when the movie becomes a bonkers "escape" film in the final 20 minutes it becomes a little funnier and gets more energy, but after two hours it's too little too late and it doesn't make up for all the floundering gags and dead spots littered throughout the move. Even the Cliff Beasts sequences which parody the Jurassic World films (even down to using similar font) aren't all that funny or engaging and it doesn't feel like Apatow's approach to this kind of satire has evolved since 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall where he took a similar approach to cookie cutter crime procedurals with Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime. The Cliff Beasts segments aren't silly enough to be all that funny and they also never feel like a true approximation of the box office crap The Bubble is poking fun at, and frankly when you have serious blockbusters like Moonfall that are far more insane and funnier than anything in The Bubble it undercuts whatever satire might've been attempted.The Bubble is unfortunately not up to the standards of its talented cast and crew. While there are brief bits of comic insanity sprinkled throughout, they're undone by an overly long runtime and the restrictive nature of the premise so the movie never really fires off. Maybe if this had been framed as a mockumentary it could've used the awkwardness and isolation more effectively, in fact the documentary film within a film Beasts of the Bubble looks like a much more entertaining film by comparison. Some good moments, but not enough for me to recommend it.
ok If you fancy a bit of escapism during these hard times then you have come to the right place. This is a pretty silly but amusing comedy about a movie production during Covid.I'm not going to lie, the film is a bit all over the place, the pacing is either super fast or super slow and at times it seems like its going on forever. The film they are filming is silly and I guess this is what you might call a parody of the industry and Hollywood.There are also a ton of Cameos, as expected from an Apatow film, this is however one of the less structured Apatow comedy's out there.Strangely enough Leslie Mann is in this film...... who would have thought Eh. Whats that ???? Iris Apatow is in this film as well. Surely she plays the daughter of Leslie Manns character ( just like in real life ) !!! No..... she doesn't., She plays the young Tik Tok star. Dennis Hoppers daughter Galen makes her screen debut in possibly one of the most pointless characters ever but she was fine I guess.Both David Duchovny and Pedro Pascal looked hungover all the way through this film, which is fine as they were playing characters who were mainly hungover.I like Karen Gillan and her character is fine, slightly dull, again often looked tired or hungover. The feeling I got is that the cast this during lockdown about filming during lockdown and just had a laugh making it under similar conditions the film was trying to portray.It was all very tongue in cheek and often seemed quite ad-libbed.I don't remember seeing Apatow in a cameo ?At times the film has some laugh out loud moments, some mildly amusing moments, Silly moments and then some really missed the mark moments. You began to wonder where its all heading and kind of switch of a little but something keeps pulling you back into this ridiculous situation.Its nothing ground breaking but it was fairly unique and a fun concept.I should really be marking this a 6 but I got hooked in and enjoyed it so its a 6.5 or 7.
ok This film was not what I had hoped for. It had big stars, an acclaimed comedy director and a promising premise but it just fell short on so many levels.The premise is about a bunch of actors and a film crew trying to make a movie during the pandemic and it starts off quite strong. I chuckled here and there, the writing was tighter and it had relatability when it came to the pandemic stuff. That's where I have to give it points, the satire was decent here but that's the only place I can give it points.The acting, cinematography, music was all okay, nothing unexpected and everyone does their job well here.It was the writing and the pacing that really brings this film down. Around 75% into the first act all the way until the credits rolled, I found myself zoning in and out of the film. This film could have been a 90 minute film or even shorter. 2 hours dragged the whole thing out and it felt like a chore to finish the film just to get it done with. There was a tongue in cheek ending which kind of makes up for a little bit of this by being self aware but even still it was very lacklustre. The jokes became very flat and I found myself have 0 reaction to any of it. Even the comic relief character was decent but they were under used and taken out of the film quite early on.Alongside this, the characters are all uninteresting and with the flat jokes and dragged out narrative, there's nothing really to keep you watching.Overall the film starts of good then slowly delves into a long drag.P. S. The choreographed dances were feel good..it was one of the few instances in the film that uplifted it alongside the welcome cameos.
bad The acting talent they had at their disposal & this is what they came up with?? Absolutely awful, the script was ridiculously bland along with just an odd aura of trying too hard.Just can't believe my subscription paid for this.
good I don't understand the low ratings. Obviously these people have absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever. It was funny and Pedro Pascal completely stole the show. I didn't know he could be so funny but he was.
ok Hollywood is hell and actors are all spoiled soulless idiots who lie for a living. Add Covid to the mix and you get a not so subtle criticism of the exotically insane art of making movies and how toxic things can get. So, a brilliant premise, but a lackluster implementation. Most of the cast are actors that I admire or at least like, but their characters were unsympathetic and the jokes dull. Funny enough, from all of the famous actors that played in the film, Iris Apatow was the one to steal the show, even if she had a completely secondary character.Bottom line: I didn't expect much and still I got disappointed. Perhaps this should have been a drama and not a comedy.
ok The Bubble follows a group of actors trying to make a movie in the middle of the Covid-19 Pandemic. However, things go awry, and the actors find themselves suck in a nightmare scenario that seems like it is meant to be a satire of the film industry. While this movie has moments, it is kind of all over the place and almost a satire of itself. The one thing this film has going for it is its cast, but there are too many characters, so they all come off as flat and one-dimensional. Daisy Radley's cameo was my favorite part. It was so random and made no sense that I couldn't help but laugh. I also enjoyed James McAvoy's cameo. All in all, The Bubble feels like Netflix's attempt to make its own version of Tropic Thunder. However, like a lot of Netflix's movies, it lacks the originality, humor, and even depth that Tropic Thunder has. I won't spoil anything, but there are a lot of comparisons that could be made between the two films. And I would highly recommend watching Tropic Thunder over this.
good I don't understand the low scores here. Sure it's not as sophisticated and touching as most Judd Apatow films but it's still really funny and realistic. It's fascinating and sure a bit traumatising watching the film cast and crew slowly go crazy in different ways, like we all remember. Of course it does go a bit gross and farcical as it goes on but in a way for good reason. And a fascinating look at the movie business too. David Duchovny is especially great in this while the others are a bit too much of caricatures. But all in all it's an amazing ensemble and a story of our times. Some great cameos too.
ok If you didn't understand the humor you won't like it. It's a great mocumentary about hollywood and quarantine mixed together. If you watch it high it's super funny so try that too.
bad This is just a cash grabbing attempt from the director. Yes good cast jokes are not funny.. too damn long... don't see the point of this thing... really don't wast 2 hours of your life with this...
bad This is a pile of garbage. It's not in any way funny, clever or satirical. This is a pile of rubbish. It is a waste of streaming time and brings down the reputation of any service that streams it. This is a huge pile of waste. Do not waste your time with it!
bad I was just looking forward to a fun Friday night movie. Nothing serious, something silly and funny. In the end the movie was just not meeting any of my expectations. It just wasn't funny... It felt neverending. Maybe they were trying to make a point with the ongoing pandemic.I do not recommend it. I don't even think that I would find it funny if I was high.
ok Not with the movie. Perfectly straightforward silly spoofy comedy. A tidge long in the middle, and probably could have been tightened up. Fred Armisen is a bit too much a skit-level character, who doesn't fully work. But otherwise just fine to rather good.What I don't get is the abject hatred for it. I mean, almost a third of ratings on (one service) are 1, 2, or 3? That's... not a thing. Even for really, really bad dumb comedies, they don't get this low a rating.I presume there's something like people who hate that this as one of the few projects to admit COVID exists driving it down? Not sure. But I am judgemental and hate lots of movies, this is just not that atrocious at all.
bad This is the most terrible, boring, meaningless excuse for a film I've had the displeasure of watching in a long, long time. Absolute trash from beginning to end. Do not waste your time on this, like I did. Life's too short.
ok A group of so-so actors who have made the dinosaur franchise 'Cliff Beasts' come to a lavish English hotel to make the sixth mostly green screen instalment whilst locked down from COVID. The studio take extreme steps to keep them filming come what may whilst the cast go slowly mad.Whilst there is much to dislike here - lots of characteristic Apatow shouting and waffling interminable rubbish that means nothing, I kinda liked this. It's a good cast with stand out comic performances for me by David Duchovny, Pedro Pascal and the ever wonderful Peter Serafinowicz. In addition if you listen and watch carefully enough there are some scenes and off the cuff remarks that lean more towards the biting satire on actors, current film audiences and Hollywood that this needed to be and at those times this is genuinely funny. You need to be tolerant around the piles of rubbish, but in the right mood this is a sweet and quite fun movie.
bad Please please avoid. This is the worst thing I have watched. Its beyond stupid. Such a shame as a great cast of stars who are usually funny but in this just terrible.
bad I like Judd Apatow and alot of his movies but this one is not on that list. There was nothing funny. David Duchovny, not funny at all. Why was he even there?I switched it over to the Watch Paint Dry channel on Youtube and got a few laughs.
good The first Sonic movie was surprisingly competent. This one is even better, incorporating additional elements from the games and sticking to more of an action-adventure plot. It's a kid's movie through and through (way more toilet humor this go-around), but a fun one that never takes itself too seriously. Everyone in my theater was having a great time with it.As with the original, Jim Carrey steals the show as Eggman. This man is 60 years old and yet he has more verve than I do! He's so energetic he sometimes resembles a cartoon more than Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails! While I respect his desire to retire, I do hope he holds on and does the third movie-- there would be such a void without him there.
good Following Dr Robotnik's exile, Sonic has settled down in rural Montana with adoptive parents Sheriff Tom and wife Maddie. What follows includes Robotnik's escape, the arrival of additional alien oddities Miles "Tails" Prower, the twin-tailed fox and Knuckles, the aggressive echidna, a marriage in Hawaii, a dance-off in Siberia, mushroom machinery, a Master Emerald, some annoying military intervention, and a giant robot.That sounds like a lot, but it's pretty straightforward stuff in a plot which aims directly at a 3-part audience - kids, tolerant parents, and mature gamers with fond memories of the original games. And I think it succeeds. It's brash, colourful, fast, eventful, funny, likeable, and has some pretty good visuals.It's not Shakespeare, it's dumb, but it's great fun.
ok Many sequels go bigger but end up being worse than the original. They lose the essence of what made the original good. That's definitely not the case here. It's much bigger but feels just like the first movie. It's on par with the original in every way, just bigger.I said this in my review of the first movie, every moment Jim Carrey is on the screen is pure gold. I wanted him to be in every scene. His facial expressions are hilarious. Whoever cast him as Robotnik is a genius. It's so perfect. I can't imagine it being anyone else.My only downsides are a few parts that don't really make sense. I chalked it up to being a kids movie but that's not really an excuse. And was I the only one who thought Idris Elba was doing something weird with Knuckles' accent? It sounded like it was switching between an English accent and a heavy New York accent, and sometimes a combination of both. I couldn't stop hearing it.I had a great time with this movie. Two out of two in the videogame genre??? That's unheard of. Keep up the good work. Maybe this is the tide turning on video game movies like it did with superhero movies in the early 2000's. I can only hope. (1 viewing, opening night 4/8/2022)
good Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the sequel to 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, a film that had a rocky development, but would listen to fans and fix its incarnation to Sonic, resulting in it being well received, and breaking the Detective Pikachu movie's record as the highest-grossing video game-based movie, and the highest-grossing superhero movie of 2020.Here, while Tom and Maddie are going to Hawaii to attend Rachel's wedding to a man named Randall, leaving Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) in charge of the house. However, Dr. Robotnik (played once again by Jim Carey) has managed to escape the Mushroom Planet with the aid of Knuckles (voiced by Idris Elba), whom he repays by taking him to Sonic so he can destroy him. However, just as Sonic is about to be creamed, a police car rams Knuckles, revealing Tails (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessy, the only VA to reprise his or her role from the video games). After finding out Longclaw left a message telling Earth is the hiding place of the Master Emerald, the one thing Knuckles seeks to restore honor to his extinct tribe (as he is the last one left).Now this is another good example of how sequels should be done. Sonic 2 is an epic film, as Sonic teams up with Tails and faces Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles. The cast from the first film returns with some new faces appearing, and the new story is awesome. Jim Carey still hams it up as the evil doctor and even Rachel gets a scene where she can be a heroine. But the best thing about this film is that it brings Knuckles back to being a serious rival to Sonic, compared to the Sega games demoting him to the role of being an idiot since the Sonic Boom cartoon. It makes me wish Sega would make notes if they saw the films, because IMHO, Paramount is basically doing Sonic better than Sega did post-Sonic Adventure 2 (it even goes as far as to give Knuckles a father, something the games would never do).However, if there are some complaints I have, it's that this movie has some scenes that are basically imitating scenes from the first film (the Siberian lounge scene reminds me of the Piston Pit scene from the first movie, only instead of a bar fight, we get a dance off), but this is a good sequel regardless. Don't pay heed to the critics bashing it and watch it if you can and see if it clicks with you.
good Incredibly entertaining and surprisingly sweet- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 improves upon its predecessor by expanding on its worlds and dynamic- executing itself better and better each step of the way. First off, I absolutely love the look of this film. Famously the Sonic CGI was replaced in the last film after an incredibly negative and honestly valid response for the characters original design- and consequently its secondary design could feel a bit rushed at times considering they changed the films main character for a film within 3 months. Not to say it was bad, but it was definitely noticeable how fast they had accomplished this fact before. With this film however, the CGI is absolutely fantastic. Of course I love a more well done and thought out Sonic design, but man do I absolutely love the look of Knuckles in this film and even the look of Sonic's signature sidekick Tails. The expansion of the world in the Sonic universe is also breathtaking, truly making my younger self's dreams come true by finally seeing this universe on the big screen. The film is also incredibly funny and even absurd at times, never taking itself too seriously, and remembering this is a film about a Blue intergalactic hedgehog- focused on fun and heart. Speaking of heart, the film was oddly moving and quite cute in its family sort of setting background with Marsden's returning character and I really enjoyed the dynamic they expanded upon with the human characters as well. Heck, even Jim Carrey's iconic villain seemed a lot better this time around, allowing Eggman to lose his mind, and therefore allowing Carrey to do what he does best. It has a few subpar moments, and a few ones that stick out, but in the end- I enjoyed the heck out of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and I honestly can't wait to watch it again.My Rating: 9.1/10.
good I never knew there was mist in the 4DK experience that was added excitement to a wildly entertaining movie! Sonic 2 is better, bigger budgeted and way more action than part 1. This is an ultimate adventure story of friendship, goofiness, and the bad guys take it up a notch. I loved this sequel quite a bit, I like how the audience clapped at the end bit.
good Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is basically everything the first Sonic movie should have been. While the first film wasn't bad per se and perfectly watchable, it was very basic and clearly limited in scope and budget. Still alright overall.Thankfully, with a sequel greenlit it feels like this time the writers and director could do much more. The CGI game characters get more of the spotlight than the Human characters, the jokes land better and there's just much more going on here that fans will recognise from the games. With Tails and Knuckles added into the roster, it adds more character dynamic and banter that fleshes them out more in the story.Robotnik also gets to shine more too thanks to Jim Carrey's performance and having more gadgets and locations to juggle with. The weakest parts of the movie are when Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik aren't on screen, but the scenes are still perfectly watchable and better than almost everything in the first film. There's more locations too and gimmicks to play around with in the movie as well.Without spoilers, fans will be most happy with Sonic 2 and even people who aren't a fan of Sonic will still get a kick out of it. Although this ain't saying much, I can confidently say this is the best Video Game Movie I've seen easily. It really felt like they put their soul and effort into it and kids will have a blast with this. Don't forget to stay to the end for a surprise. There will definitely be a third film coming.7.5/10.
good A delightful follow up to Sonic the Hedgehog(2020), for anybody that are fans of Sonic, where Tails and Knuckles make an appearance, what fans have been waiting for. And it is fun film for the whole family, and has great effects and good characters, and I also like that everybody much shines here not just Sonic.Now I'll bet Jim Carrey improvised all of his lines, it's like the filmmakers just let Jim Carrey do his thing, cause I'll bet they thought it was funnier than the script. You see he's really milking it for all it's worth.
ok Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022) is a great sequel and might be better than the first movie.Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba were all great as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Sonic and Tails were great together and had a cute friendship.Knuckles was funny in how he didn't understand most things but he is tough and wants to complete his quest for the Master Emerald.Jim Carrey was still great as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman, he is still funny and gives a over the top performance that shows he is having fun with it.The action scenes are fun and awesome seeing with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles interacting off each other. Especially the Sonic vs Knuckles fight, it is worth seeing on the big screen.The 3rd act is amazing and fun while also having Easter eggs from the games that Sonic fans will recognize and find funny. Also the different locations they go to are nicely shot.The after credits scene is amazing and will get you excited for the future of the Sonic movie series. Sonic fans will love it.The movie is fun, funny, and has epic moments that are worth seeing in the theater. The characters are likable and the human characters like James Marsden were also great and funny.
ok "Sonic The Hedgehog 2" is the sequel to the 2020 video game film adaptation of SEGA's "Sonic The Hedgehog". Starring James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Jim Carrey, as well as the voice talents of Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba, it is a decent continuation that's sure to entertain both fans of the games and the previous film.Sometime after the events of first film, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has taken it upon himself to become a hero that others can rely on in Green Hills, Montana. After causing a great deal of collateral damage foiling a bank robbery, Sonic is forced to housesit for Tom (James Marsden) and Maddie (Tika Sumpter) while the two are attending a wedding in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik (Jim Carrey) has returned from the Mushroom Planet thanks to the help of Knuckles the Echidna (voiced by Idris Elba) to seek out the powerful Master Emerald, which will help them conquer the world. After learning of this, Sonic teams up with his new fox friend Miles "Tails" Prower (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) to stop both Dr. Eggman and Knuckles before they can wreak havoc with the Emerald.What I believe made the first "Sonic The Hedgehog" movie such a success was how it managed to appeal to hardcore Sonic fans while also functioning as an amusing family film in its own right. Something like this is easier said than done because various other movies based on video games have tried too hard to be as close to the original games as possible, alienating uninitiated viewers in the process. Because of how it was able to rise above this common mistake, I rank the first Sonic movie among the best video game related films of all time (although considering the lack of competition, the bar isn't exactly very high). Most of what made its predecessor work so well has been replicated here in the sequel, as it provides about the same amount of entertainment value one might expect from a follow-up.Deviating from the original, this film has a slightly darker tone since the Emerald is shown to be something that could easily destroy all of life as we know it. Because of this, we see Sonic actually treating this as a serious threat, limiting the amount of jokes and wisecracks he makes when attempting to hunt it down. This could be compared to the power of Infinity Stones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where their use has the potential to cause catastrophic damage if it were to fall into the wrong hands. I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate to the games since I'm only a casual fan of the series but it all seems like a typical plot device one would see when playing something related to Sonic the Hedgehog.However, things aren't all doom and gloom since that signature fun factor is still there to prevent things from becoming too bleak. Sonic, who is now joined by his good friend Tails, can be seen dancing off against foes to some catchy songs on his iPhone and snowboarding down mountainous slopes in Siberia. Scenes like these are as fast-paced and likeable as the blue hedgehog himself, elevating the film above the usual onslaught of family movie fodder designed solely towards very small children. To my surprise, Sonic now only seems to use his superspeed sparingly rather than just for the sake of it. Perhaps this was done in an effort to develop Sonic more as a character using his head instead of mindlessly speeding around, or maybe they simply didn't want to show Sonic being way too overpowered. Either way, it is an interesting creative decision.Visually, the film looks considerably better than its predecessor. Years ago, many people on the internet infamously cyber-bullied the makers of the first film into changing Sonic's look, winning out in the end with his current design. Normally I'm against this type of vitriolic attack on filmmakers but after seeing the fixed product, I'd say it was all for the best. I'm not sure how they were able to pull it off, but Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all look well integrated into our world. Scenes where human characters were interacting with Sonic, both physically and verbally, all looked quite convincing, as though there really were an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog sitting next to them or dancing alongside them in a bar.I also like how each of the three characters' distinct colours did a clever job of representing their personality traits. Sonic's blue stands out as he confidently speeds past everybody, Tails's orange highlights his supportive nature, and Knuckles' red perfectly mirrors his angry determination. Whether or not this was done intentionally I'm not entirely sure but if it was, then it was a nice addition the film. With that in mind, it also makes it easier to distinguish each of them from a distance, especially during certain action scenes where many things were happening at once.Like last time, Ben Schwartz does a great job playing up Sonic's cocky attitude to full effect. Although he still has that streak of impulsivity, Sonic this time feels as though he is trying to make an effort to use his intellect rather than just his speed to hunt down the Master Emerald. It was also nice to hear Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprise her role as Tails from the video games, as I can't really think of any other mainstream actors capable of voicing the loveable two-tailed fox. If you enjoyed O'Shaughnessey's voice of Tails in the games, then you are sure to like how she is able to hold her own alongside the rest of the cast. Idris Elba is appropriately irritable and brutally strong as the voice of Knuckles. Elba seems to be voicing Knuckles in the vein of the MCU's Thor in his first appearance, in that he is very powerful and one track minded but ignorant to basic things like food and recreational activities.Jim Carrey's performance as Dr. Eggman was easily my favourite thing about the original film. I remember laughing out loud quite a lot at the over-the-top material the writers gave him to work with. It was almost as though the character has been personally tailored to make use of all his comedic talents. This time, he bears a stronger resemblance to his video game counterpart, complete with a bald head and comically huge moustache, and like before he steals the show in virtually every scene he is in. For a man in his 60s, Carrey still demonstrates a considerable amount of versatility and physical dexterity when playing this iconic villain. I look forward to seeing more of Carrey's version of Dr. Eggman in future Sonic films.As far as video game movies and sequels are concerned, "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" is a fun follow-up that is able to recapture what made the original a success in the first place. It isn't afraid to be goofy fun if it wants to be but it also doesn't shy away from serious moments whenever it feels necessary. If you liked the first film, then it stands to reason that you should like this one as well. Judging by the mid-credits scene, it seems there are some more surprises on the horizon so Sonic fans definitely ought to stay tuned.I rate it 7/10.
good This one was better than Sonic 1. It had better Jokes, more violence, and better characters!! This is also a perfect kids movie, with only two adult jokes!! Jim Carrey returned for the role of Dr. Robotnick and boy did Jim Carrey over act. It had more overacting than the first one but it is funnier!! Great movie go watch it!!
ok If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.Jeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.Taking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.Fun for kids and adults alike."Rating: B.
good 4.5 out of 5 stars.Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a really good action adventure film that adults and children will enjoy. It is a bigger and more epic sequel to the original. Fans of the game series will love. The story is bigger. Taking Sonic and Tails on a adventure for the emerald which Robotnik and Knuckles is after.The film does have a lot of action sequences that are bigger and intense. The visual effects are outstanding. The new characters are fun addition like Tails and Knuckles. Robotnik goes through some changes which fans of the game series will love. Especially during the climax with his giant robot battling Sonic and Tails.The cast did great with there roles. The voice talent also did good. The film does have some fun humor. And some cheesy humor which is an eye roll. With the scope of the film with its action. Story and humor. It is forgiven.The film does have a mid credit scene that sets up for a sequel. This film is one fun action packed sequel that goes bigger.
good Don't believe the critic's they are still mad the first film made more then any of the Disney films that have came out in the past 3 years. Even made more then boring Encanto that some how won on Oscar. Anyways if you want a movie made for adults and children to enjoy this is the film for you. Jim Is hilarious as always. Anyways if you loved the first you will surely love this movie as well.
good The wild, fun and adventurous blue hedgehog we all love, Sonic a.k.a. Blue Justice, is back in his new movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 2! This film has new character appearances, major plot twists, mind-blowing adventures, and tons of laughs throughout it. It's great that this sequel is one of those movies you can enjoy without seeing the original; however, since it refers to different scenes from the first one, you may want to watch the original first.In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, or Dr. Eggman as Sonic calls him (Jim Carrey), returns to Earth with a new ally, Knuckles (Idris Elba), in hopes of finding a magical gem that holds the ultimate power of the universe. All that stands in their way is Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his new partner in crime, Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey). It's a battle of good and bad to see who will reach the emerald first and win in the end.The main characters are Sonic, Dr. Robotnik, Tails and Knuckles. I love how this film introduces characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and they just fit in seamlessly. One of the voice actors who surprised me is Idris Elba. His voice is the perfect match to portray Knuckle's strong and confident personality. My favorite part is when Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) and Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter) are at Rachel's wedding and need to open a portal for Sonic; Tom realizes he may have mistaken the wedding ring for one of Sonic's golden rings. It adds some hilarious adventure to the wedding. Kudos to Junkie XL for keeping an "old school" feel throughout the film with songs such as It's Tricky by Run D. M. C. And Here Comes the Hotstepper by Ini Kamoze.This film sheds light on the importance of having family and friends in your life. They will always have your back and keep you on the right path in life. Sonic and the other characters experience different obstacles that teach them the true definition of a family, even if they come as friends.Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is out of this world. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The "battle of the gem" takes place in theaters on April 8, 2022. Be sure to stay for the after-credits movie scene.

good I just came back from seeing this film in the cinema and I had a goddamn blast with it! Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a movie that knows what it wants to be and runs with it, resulting in a more fun and enjoyable experience than the already fun and enjoyable predecessor. I won't say much else since I want people to check it out (see the first film before though for more context) for themselves.I'll end by saying two things, bring on the third one, and please let Mario's upcoming movie be good too.
good It's a blast filled with cringe jokes and some actually funny ones. Maybe just a bit too long but I didn't mind too much. The additional new characters in the movie were great too. What I love most is that there seems to be a lot of love and fun put in when making these films and you can see that when watching it.
ok This film is a very fun time. Sonic and Tails are a delight, Knuckles is epic and the action is great. Jim Carey's energy is amazing as Robotnik and the humour is pretty solid (although its missing the more witty humour the first had at times).However, the film is slightly ruined by the humans. Tom and Maddie are fine and are hardly in the film.But the entire film is utterly dragged down by a 15 minute sequence in the middle involving the bride raging at her wedding being crashed. When Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Eggman don't appear for 15 minutes straight, something has gone wrong. The acting was horrendous in this scene and it was as if an awful cheesy romance film was shoved into a Sonic film.The third act regained some momentum but it started to drag on by the end. If the wedding scenes didn't happen, the pacing would be fine.Sonic becoming Super Sonic was epic, although its weird Robotnik's fate is unclear. The ending was very sweet as well.And that post-credit scene... wow!Overall, Sonic 2 is a fun time but when I rewatch it I'll be skipping the human scenes.
ok This movie definitely felt like a step up from the previous which was good but kind of just felt like a road trip movie that just happened to have Sonic and Robotinik dropped in the middle of it, this one felt more aligned with the items and locations of the games and had a lot more fanservice in it, with more action and comedyI have had a soft spot for the Sonic games, the original 2D games revolutionised 2D platformers at the time, however the 3D games always felt behind innovation though some are better than others. Sonic 06 and Rise of Lyric are definitely the worst ones, though can still be entertaining if you love hilarious glitches and super cheesy writing and scenesThis movie however is still quite good despite having a few flays, Jim Carrey's acting as Robotnik has been taken a step up on the cheese factor and now feels like a full fledged cartoon character with the dial all the way up to 10, than just Jim Carrey pretending to be Robotnik. He even feels more cartoonified than what Eggman was in most of the recent games, but Jim knows how to get into that zone and stay there because he lives and breathes that styleI really liked the addition of Tails in the movie and felt very faithful to the character, Knuckles was good too but kind of felt like he was dumbed down a little compared to the wisecracking character of the games to an extent. I also wasn't a real big fan of his African accent, but it makes sense why they made him that way. I didn't like how Tails was unconscious for almost 20 minutes with no dialogue and it felt lazy to me, like they were compensating for not having enough lines for him in a very cheap way.I did like how the Chaos Emeralds were more focussed upon in this movie aswell as the Master Emerald, and it was fun to see Sonic turn into Super Sonic at the end, though I thought they could have played a bit more with it in that scene and felt it was a bit too short and glossed over too quicklyOverall, I had a fun time with this movie and I think fans will like it a lot too, it felt more like a Sonic adventure in this one and I liked that, maybe we'll see Shadow and Amy make an appearance in the 3rd one.
good I'm genuinely confused on why critics are going out of their way to try and review these films as if they were trying to be Gone with the Wind. For me personally I felt like this was one of the better video game movies I have ever seen. The addition of the other video game characters and only make this 1000 times more entertaining than the first one. I also felt like the rivalry between sonic and knuckles really worked and you can tell that there was a lot of animosity between the characters which was the point of their rivalry. It's not perfect, or some things with the human characters that are pretty boring and obnoxious. I just don't get why they won't make a movie about the characters from the game themselves and not try and add a bunch of side human characters to further along a less interesting plot. Other than that I really like that I really don't understand why critics are so hard on this franchise. Every complaint that I've seen about this movie they are saying that this is a cash grab for sonic. This is a sonic movie! Why would they not be using elements from the games that are related to sonic if it's a sonic movie? That's ridiculous. Same thing with Uncharted I just think critics are way too hard on these video game movies because of the stigma around them. For me... This is just as good if not better than the first one. Also stay for the credits if you're a fan of a franchise... OH MY GOD!!!
good As a fan of the games, I had an idea of where the story was going within the first 15 minutes of the film. With that being said, the execution of the plot and writing with both new and returning characters, made the build up to the finale very entertaining and worth my time. It's a little slow at the beginning but once Tails and Knuckles join the cast, it's a thrilling race to the finish; and what a finish it is! There are some twists I didn't see coming and I won't spoil the 3rd act which is the peak of the film. Think Spider-Man No Way Home: Sega version! Yes, the 3rd act is that good and it gave me goosebumps. Very enjoyable film for fans and newcomers alike and definitely STAY for the mid-credits scene.
ok I saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2, starring James Marsden-Westworld_tv, Death at a Funeral; Ben Schwartz-Space Force_tv, Night School; Idris Elba-The Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond; Colleen O'Shaughnessey-The Blacklist_tv, The fresh Prince of Bel_Air_tv and Jim Carrey-Kick_Ass 2, Liar Liar.This is the sequel to the 2020 movie based on the popular video games. Ben voices Sonic, the super fast alien hedgehog that has been adopted by James. When James goes on a vacation, Ben is left to fend for himself until Jim/Dr Robotnik makes his surprising return-he was banished to another planet at the end of the first movie. Idris voices Knuckles, an Echidna alien that is searching for a powerful emerald that happens to be hidden on Earth. Idris teams up with Jim-Jim wants the emerald too-and the race is on as to who can find the emerald first. Ben has Colleen-voicing Tails-to help him. There is plenty of action and humor to keep you entertained-and lots of Easter eggs for the ones familiar with the video games-and there is a scene just as the end credits starts that fore shadows the next movie. Oh yeah, there will be a third. FYI: I don't know if it's true or not but I have read that this will be Jim Carrey's last movie-he is retiring, evidently.It's rated PG for action, violence, rude humor and mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.If you liked the first one, you should enjoy this one too. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.
good Jim Carry and Idris Elba were definitely the crowd stealers in this sequel to the 2020 film. This movie had more laughs, more action, and lots more fun.I love him Carry and I love Idris Elbow on their own so them together was just spectacular.
good Drags on a bit long though still a refinement on its prequel. Jeff Fowler established every characters into frenetic adventure for whole family. Carrey elevated his quirky villain mode. Knuckles & Tails were capably assembled with Sonic's heartfelt efforts.
good Such a fun, great movie, tons of easter eggs for those who grew up on sonic too. Everything was perfect. This is how video game movies should be. I can't wait for more. IDRIS was amazing as Knuckles. He was so on point. The man was born to play that role. It was such a great vibe for them to get Colleen to do the voice of Tails. She is Tails. I loved all the easter eggs, the jokes. And most of all JIM. The man is a legend. If This happens to be his last movie ever. What a way to go out. He killed it. Can't wait to own this movie.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, "The best stories are rooted in reality."Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez ("The Office").Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.
ok Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of "The Lost City of D," but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.
ok The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.Writing: 3/10
ok A cute and funny enough rom com, a few more of the jokes were stale than I would have liked, but overall it accomplished its goal. A few laughs, a few "awhs", and a whole lotta "omg is Channing Tatum hot"'d.
ok 7.0/10I actually enjoyed this film way more than I expected. It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the "prologue" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil "I want to murder everyone" kind of bad guy.By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time....
ok The first half of this movie is really funny. I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.In the second half, the laughs slow down drastically. It gets a lot more serious with attempts at character arcs and story moments that aren't bad but are things we've seen a thousand times. I didn't hate watching it, but without as much comedy it's a much weaker movie.The first half is easily seven stars. The second half is a weak six. I wouldn't mind watching this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. (1 viewing, opening Thursday night 3/24/2022)
ok The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie.
good Got to see the early ish screening considered date night on the regal app that was great time! One of the funniest things set up in the is experience was showing a short trailer of the movie 6 times that's never been a thing and there was feature before the movie started mostly talking about the red dress being a character itself that was silly. Didn't expect as much comedy as there was and highly entertaining action even an excellent soundtrack! I don't know about others but I loved the movie.
good It would be easy to call this a knockoff of Indiana Jones, but in some ways it kind of knows it, has a fun self aware vibe to it. It's merely just a satire of those treasure adventure films.Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have good chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly you can tell they are having a blast. Tatum is having fun paroding his pretty boy image. Daniel Radcliffe is quite the scene stealer has an over the top villain. It's just a fun movie, delivers some incredible laughs, and not for the faint hearted.
good Novelist Loretta, at the start of an unwelcome book tour, is kidnapped by nutjob rich boy Fairfax, who believes that an earlier book means that she holds the key to deciphering where an item of untold value rests. She is pursued by Alan, the cover model for her romantic novels, who is a bit on the dim and inept side.This romantic comedy action thriller seems to be Indiana Jones for laughs, but actually has 3 things going for it. The first is Sandra Bullock as Loretta. Loretta is not comedy or romantic or action. She is actually a really sad character, in self-imposed (emotional)isolation after the sudden death of her husband five years earlier. The gradual re-emergence of this damaged person in the course of her often very funny ordeal is a quiet joy.The second is Channing Tatum, once more sending up his hunk status, and he does so with a performance which is emotionally sincere is it is comedic. These two sell the evolution of their relationship very well.The third is the scriot. It is always amusing, and there are a handful of genuinely cleve, funny lines.Daniel Radcliffe is present, and encouraged to chew the scenery. He doesn't need the encouragement.
ok I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but on the whole, I did, some bits of it were pretty silly, but there were some nice moments, and a few bits that had me in stitches. Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.Nice special effects, it looks great, I loved the locations used. You can argue it had a somewhat old fashioned, maybe old school vibe about it, but sometimes you just need a bit of silliness in your life.Nicely acted, they all did a good job, Daniel Radcliffe was good fun, always enjoy his work.It really does make the most of Channing Tatum's looks, and it does work, he is ridiculously handsome, and there are several tongue in cheek moments, he seems like a good sport.7/10.
good I saw a screening of this and thought hey it's probably gonna be another cheesy action comedy but hey free. I didn't have high expectations but I have to say this movie was HILARIOUS! Good action. Really good comedy and even though it's 2 hours long it was good pacing. Definitely worth a watch!
good Liked: This wasn't the typical romcom that is sappy and silly. Performances by everyone that had screen time. Pacing was great too.Not so much: Editing. There seems like a small chunk of the movie was missing and they tried to cover it with a quick transition.Loved: Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe. Both stole the show in each scene they were in.I really enjoyed this flick. Way more than I thought I was going to. I'm glad I saw this because this flick wasn't the typical sappy and silly romcoms tend to be associated with. It was action packed, had a lot of humor in it with some solid performances. Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe were awesome in this. Pitt nailed all his comedic timing and Radcliffe has great range and played the villain role really well. So much that one day he should play a Bond villain. Looked like he was having a lot of fun with this. No post credit but there is a great mid credit scene that adds to the story. Solid movie!
good I have to be honest I didn't think Bullock and Tatum would mesh well together. But the chemistry they had in this movie was unforgettable. I laughed for the first hour of this movie. It was a fun and exciting movie Overall this felt like another Uncharted movie, but I enjoyed that movie so it worked. I recommend it you want to just laugh your ass off! I must say Brad Pitt in this movie was so SEXY! So was Tatum, Radcliffe, and Bullock, but I wished to have seen more of Pitt. I will definitely recommend this movie to others. I myself will be watching this one again when I need to disconnect and literally l.m.f.a.o!
good I try to avoid watching trailers before I see a movie. Sometimes it is inevitable - you can't escape certain trailers. So while I still managed not to see everything the trailer revealed, I already knew from the looks of it, that I would like the movie. And lo and behold the movie delivers the goods.There may be certain role reversals (or gender cliches that are being made fun of if you want to call it that), but the way the actors are playing their roles will not make you think too much about that. At least not in a negative light - some people seem to be allergic when it comes to "wokeness" I reckon.Channing Tatum has no problem taking his own image apart. Though he still will not accept bad dancing - but that is a different story. Harry Radcliffe ... I mean Daniel Potter ... ah well, the guy formerly known - actually still known as Harry Potter plays quite the fine villain.There is an excellent cameo in this and there is also a bonus scene during the credits that you cannot miss under any circumstances. Sit back, relax and if the humor is your cup of tea, you'll have a blast with this.
good IN A NUTSHELL:
ok 2022's The Lost City is just plain fun. Escapists and popcorn munchers are welcome. It's one of those action-adventure vehicles where the protagonists supply the sarcastic quips in the face of swashbuckling danger. "Jungles eat people like us". Need I say more.Directed with jungly cinematography by those Nee brothers (Aaron and Adam), "City" is like the goofy cousin of a certain '84 Robert Zemeckis flick and any Indiana Jones endeavor. It's a riff but a good riff that's not to be taken as serious. There's supposed hidden treasure, chases, snakes featured, and for added effect, leeches too.The Lost City stars Sandra Bullock as a novelist who gets kidnapped when one of her stories reveals the location of fortune in an ancient burgh (sound familiar?). The role of writer Loretta Sage is perfect for a bumbling, physical comic like Bullock. It's like her agent said, "oh yeah, this is a no-brainer"."City" also has Brad Pitt in it as a Navy Seal (Jack Trainer) sent to rescue Sage from the already rich baddies. When he exits, well it's almost a buzzkill. Piggybacking on his intimidating persona via Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pitt just reminds us again that he's a legend. His bone-crunching action sequences in "City" give the film a shot in the arm that doesn't quite sustain for the rest of the running time (1 hour-plus). Sure "City" is motion full tilt but finishes with less cowbell.In thinking back, "City's" look could almost pass as boost animation. The dialogue is improvised, the characters are dispassionate (yet funny), and because of the breezy tone (intertwined with PG-13 violence), The Lost City is a true to type, moviegoer's movie. It's basically one of the reasons we hit the cineplex on a Friday at 7-ish. Call it "Advancing" the Stone.
ok 3 out of 5 stars.Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were great with there on screen chemistry and worked great with providing humor. Taking them on a adventure to searching for the lost city before the bad guys go after the search. The cast is good. The concept is fun. The film does have some humor and entertainment. The plot is forgettable. And the film does have a small amount of humor that cant carry the movie.
good The Lost City is a nice reminder of the kind of film's they don't really make anymore, a great comedy adventure that moves along nicely, is frequently very funny and propelled along by the A-List cast who are all having a blast.Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum both give incredible lead performances with fantastic chemistry, equally really funny but also showing real growth by the end. Daniel Radcliffe is really good as an extremely enjoyably evil antagonist, managing to leave a lasting impression with limited screen time.Adam and Aaron Nee's direction is excellent, the action scenes are surprisingly strong and the film overall looks really nice, helped by the practicality of it all (mostly). The soundtrack and the music by Pinar Toprak are both a lot of fun and appropriately playful.
ok Surprisingly effective and funny. It's one of those Saturday post-lunch films, a feel-good, light, not challenging, mostly predictable but very efficient in what it does and wants to be.I was surprised in feeling tense during parts of the last act and really liked the chemistry of Bullock and Tatum. Fantastic cameo by Pitt! I was not expecting, but this was really fun.
ok An Adventure Comedy with Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, and Daniel Radcliffe! Sounds dumb but maybe it will be fun.There were some moments that were funny, especially that leech scene shown in the trailer, but most of them felt flat. Tatum and Pitt were the only funny people. Sandra Bullock wasn't that remarkable. Daniel Radcliffe tried to be over-the-top with his villain, but he only ended up annoying. The adventure itself wasn't anything special either.Overall, there's little fun. 5-5.5/10.
good The Lost City is a very funny and entertaining film, which in reality is all I expected and wanted from it.It has a story that is very predictable and derivative, but that doesn't mean its not a good time. The script is pretty well put together, with plenty of solid jokes and a premise that leads to lots of entertaining hijinks.Sandra Bullock is a fantastic comedy actress and she shines in this role. Her timing and delivery are on point, leading to some terrific laugh out loud moments. Channing Tatum is in fine form, as he really excels in these sorts of roles where he's given license to just have a good time. The interplay between the two of them was loads of fun to watch. Daniel Radcliffe was a bit of a weak antagonist, with a pretty weak performance to match I thought, so that side of things was a tad disappointing.Although it is unlikely to blow you away, The Lost City is sure to entertain. A charismatic leading pair, serviceable plot, and plenty of jokes that land add up to a very fun watch indeed.
bad Literally how stupid does Hollywood think we are. I can forgive a plot that is 90% lifted from romancing the stone but the dialogue is utter garbage. Unfunny and embarrassing. Go see the Dora the Explorer movie...much better script and acting lol. Also Sandra Bullock and her frozen face and huge wig are ridiculous.
bad I can't quite understand how these actors would choose to make such a unfunny comedy. The humor is so basic and simple that I can't believe the actors thought this would work. With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out. It's just a complete and utter fail from the very beginning. All I was wondering throughout the film is "why?"
ok I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from the 2022 comedy "Metal Lords" from writer D. B. Weiss and director Peter Sollett as I sat down to watch the movie. Why? Well, first of all I hadn't heard about the movie, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. And secondly, then the synopsis for the movie just seemed a bit too generic for a movie of this kind. But still, I opted to watch "Metal Lords".Turns out that "Metal Lords" was actually rather enjoyable. Sure, it was somewhat on the generic side in terms of innovation and creativity for a movie such as this. But still, it proved to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie. And that was definitely a large part because of the cast and their performances. But the storyline certainly was adequate enough.Lead actors Adrian Greensmith (playing Hunter) and Jaeden Martell (playing Kevin) were rather well-cast for "Metal Lords", and they carried the movie quite well.I will say that "Metal Lords" was definitely a movie suited for me, because I've been listening to metal since I was around 11 or 12 years old or so, and been playing roleplaying games for that very same amount of time, and I am almost 47 by now. So the metal references and the Dungeons & Dragons references throughout the movie were as if tailored for my interests.I was genuinely entertained by "Metal Lords", because it was a movie that transcended being just another run-of-the-mill movie about youngsters forming a metal band and going against the mainstream. There were also good elements of friendship, love, being an outsider and not a bland face in the crowd, and such, so it was a well-rounded movie.My rating of "Metal Lords" lands on a seven out of ten stars.
good This movie rocked! Not only the kids acted great, but they were perfect for their roles: cute when they were playing it real, hard when they suffered and inspiring as rock singers. The film uses metal band shenanigans to tell the story of how young people feel and are treated by the world and how they treat each other, but it is never blunt or preachy and allows all characters to evolve. The more I think about the film, the more I like it.Also, awesome song at the end. Not really a metal fan, but even if you don't enjoy the rest of the film that much, the ending song makes it worth it.
good I really enjoyed this movie, not just because I like metal but because it speaks of adolescence, of friendship, bullies, virgins, geeks, love and most importantly for me, it includes mental health as a real every day issue. Sweet movie.
good So if I had to balance this movie in-between 2 spots it would have to be high school drama and metal music. This movie has a taste of both and it is not boring or uninteresting at all. Loved it and will totally see it again, if only for the music. Loved the acting and thought Mr. Martel is coming into his own very well. Cannot wait to see what he is in next!
good It was almost refreshing!!! A little quirky - but lots of fun. It's not really a children's movie - it's got some mature language and elements to it - but it's fun. It's actually a refreshing change from a lot of the normal dribble! I'm giving it high praise just for being fresh!
good It's th perfect movie for a weekend evening. It's a bit comedy, a bit drama, a bit teenage angst, a bit romcom and a lot of heavy metal noise. It also includes some great cameos from veteran heavy metal rockers.
good I thought the writing was excellent and the acting swell and everyone did a great job! Totally fun and cute and sweet all the way around! I can't believe how fun and real and stylistic the thing was! I hope to see more of this! Very cool very fun, Thank-you Mr. Netflix whoemver the people are who get these things in there!
good I've been a metalhead for 30+ years, I've been in bands my youth... This movie hit me so hard, I cried twice. Not exactly because of what was happening on screen, but the sudden rush of memories and the comparison between my life then and now. War Pigs, man, that song also always gets me, metal anthem.The girl, Isis Hainsworth, man what an actress!
good This movie can be fully understood and appreciated only by a true metal fan, especially around fourty years old.The rest of you, wherever you are, just enjoy the film...
good The 3 kids were great in this. Greensmith as Hunter was fantastic, possessed. Determined at a Metal band beyond all reason and common sense, a natural at comedy. Martell as Schlieb the ultra sincere nerd without a passion until he finds metal and drums. And Hainsworth as Emily the consumate possessed pretty girl in frump frocks that can rock a cello and Olympian javelin throw a clarinet.If this sounds good to you, watch it. I did laughing throughout the show esp. The Crusty the Clown segment...played perfectly by obsessed Greensmith and his plastic surgeon implant fondling laissez faire dad played wonderfully by Gelman.
good More than a decade after School of Rock, I've liked a movie which is as genuine as it can get about rock and metal. This is a great movie for metal and hard rock lovers. Good to hear some legendary metal songs referenced in the movie. Ending is awesome. Machinery of Torment \m/
good Really enjoyed this movie and I'm not even a metal fan! The subject matter was handled great and the characters were flawless !Good story, great music, overall a very fun film. Highly recommended.
good Oh god I had so much fun watching this! So awesome!!! Metal!!!!!! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜
ok In all honesty this movie starts as a rambling, awkward mess which slowly becomes punctuated by moments of touching brilliance coming out of seemingly nowhere.Shy teenager Kevin traipses through high school all the while being dragged along by his best friend Hunter, whose dreams of becoming a metal god threaten to tear down the very two man band he's built. Together they traverse friendship, love, and most of all what it means to keep everything "Metal".While I was struggling to keep myself engaged in this seemingly flop of a movie, a poignant and well executed turn in the story made me sit up straight in my seat. From there on I was treated to what became an increasingly riveting story with characters that extended beyond the superficial.I was particularly touched with a surprisingly complex character suffering from mental illness, treated with finesse and a level of understanding that I can only surmise comes from real world experience.Overall this movie was not your typical coming of age teen rom com, and you can expect a somewhat sophisticated peek into the lives of teenagers finding their own, messy ways into adulthood and what it ultimately means to find acceptance in yourself and others.HEAVY. METAL. FOREVER!!!
good Lots of references and nods to Metal and D&D. Captures the trials and tribulations of being a loser at school.Don't try to and analyze and critique this too much.....just solid fun, with some heart. Enjoy!
good But beware the Justice for all TAB Book is full of mistakes. I sadly learned the record by this book...outschThe story is cool and there are 4 really cool cameos \m/The actors are great and the clichÃ©s are NOT exaggerated.
good Being a rock/metal bassist myslef, I must declare my innate bias in favour of this movie.As a kid who grew up listening to 80s thrash metal, this move resonates very well with me. I loved the soundtrack and the cameos they pulled off for this movie.This film is just like the genre of metal, itself;You either get it. Or you don't.Fans of the genre will enjoy it on at least some level.
good C'mon...it's a "coming of age" teen movie. Manage your expectations here. That said, I thought it was fun and well executed. The cameos alone are worth the watch. And there was a moment in the movie where I thought "well good for him!" ...Thank you Rob Halford of Judas Priest. All in, if you've got a couple hours to kill, enjoy the last 50 years of of metal, and want to see a positive spin on the genre, give this a shot.
ok My initial feeling going into this was that it was going to be like School of Rock. It didn't take long to see that this wasn't going to be the case. Despite it being a completely different movie, it still had all of the makings and opportunity to be just as good. Metal Lords could have and should have been an instant classic. It was not.As with ALL Netflix productions, the budget is there. Therefore the production is top notch. The staffing is top notch. The cinematogrophy is top notch. The music, especially here, was top notch. The writing and pacing? Nowhere to be found. Does Netflix hire tik tokers to write this stuff, or edit it?The three main actors were great for their rolls, but the script was inadequate. I don't blame them.There were moments that were unearned like the drum kit acquisition, the romance between the two leads, the moment of cheating at the wedding party, the invitation and discovery of the cellist, the check in and escape of the recovery center. These all could have been better fleshed out, but they blew through this stuff to make room for a bully, a secondary romantic influence, a mental disorder, and an unrealistic timeline to be prepared for a live show.There was no need for a bully dynamic in this movie, plus it never got resolved. There was no need for the false romantic interest since they had the actual romantic interest between the drummer and cellist.And why, why, why do movies insist on unrealistic timelines? We're not looking for suspense in a rock movie. If they need six months or a year to get ready, let them have that. But not two weeks.I'm not sure what the sideplot with the mental disorder was either. In a different movie, this might have worked. In this movie, it made a monster out of what should have been a great character.The fast lovers dynamic was icky. These are teenagers, right? Is this how they talk and progress into a sexual relationship these days? God help us if this is accurate.I like that the movie did not just try and immitate School of Rock. I like that it attempted to investigate some of these offshoots within the teenager dynamic. I think they played on too many negative aspects painting a bleak picture of what a teenager's life looks like. These were pretty awful teens with completely absent parents.If this movie could have established a point and focused on that point, this could have been a spectacular movie. Unfortunately it dabbled in too many topics and themes and had no identity. The poor characters had no identity.I give it a 6 out of 10 for trying and almost being something good.Maybe one day, Netflix will simply sign the damn checks and stop interfering with artistic liberties. I've seen brand name directors attatched to Netflix Originsls. I know they work together. Let them work.
good Great coming-of-age film, a story of friendship, teenage, love, illness and of course... MUSIC. Very sweet and genuine.It kind of reminded me of Deathgasm (2015), in a way, except without the horror.I will definitely see it again, to experience the character development once more, I thought it was really well done.It's not Oscar material, I get it. But as a musician myself, it's hard not to love a film like this! This is what modern kids should see, in order to get a real opinion of what music really is.
good This made me want to call all my metal head friends from high school & tell them about this movie! It was a great mix of emotion & humor with some EXCELLENT familiar metal hits. I also love a good underdog flick.
ok Even though not top notch production and the pitch of the plot and the knitting together of the whole productionsjalabaise feels a bit immature at moments. But the music is the drive, and loads of heavy riffs and raffs you get wether you like it or not, and the acts by the 3 mains are just as acustic as al di meolas guitarplay and andrew lloyd webbers celloloid and billy cobhams drumdrills, and it looks darn real for life.So if you have a wet dream to start a grungerockband or maybe a bandaid or just want to make your own hardrock movie, then youll have something to learn from and try to peel away some of the glitches made in this production, cause the grumpy old man doesnt think its perfect, but its massivly beautiful anyway.
ok Mini-Harry Potter and Young-Shia LaBeouf make a deadly duo in this musically engaging movie (you are in for a ton of heavy metal songs, stick to the end of the credits for a bit of relief for your ears).
good Brought me back to High School... starting a metal was def a lot like this movie. Great fun but also so much drama! This movie was a very enjoyable tale about kids trying to find their way and backed by the power of being different and metal! Will be a classic on my shelf next to my Les Paul Guitar and Marshall Amp.
good In a generation of garbage music, it was great to see a high school heavy metal movie. Good story, nice visits from heavy metal royalty, some funny moments, and overall entertaining movie.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Graham Moore won an Oscar for his screenplay on Alan Turing's life in THE IMITATION GAME (2014). Now he has directed his first feature film, one he co-wrote with Johnathan McClain. The final product is a bit unusual in that it takes place almost entirely in one spot ... a tailor's shop ... and features only a handful of characters. It's a film that would transition easily to the stage for live performances.Mark Rylance (Oscar winner for BRIDGE OF SPIES, 2015) excels here as Leonard, a Savile Row-trained tailor now working his craft in his own shop in 1956 Chicago. His path from London to the windy city is a bit murky, but we immediately take note of Leonard's calm and elegant presence accompanied by his soothing voice. Rylance uses that voice as narrator to explain the intricacies involved with creating a man's suit, and the importance of reading the man prior to utilizing the 4 fabrics and 38 pieces that make-up the outfit. Leonard is also protective of Mable (Zoey Deutch, ZOMBIELAND: DOUBLE TAP, 2019), his assistant who dreams of traveling the globe.An early montage shows us how the mob utilizes Leonard's shop for drops, and trusts him due to his 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' demeanor. Leonard is one cool dude, and it's obvious we (and the mob) are underestimating him ... but we can't quite figure out why or by how much. One crazy night changes everything. Richie (Dylan O'Brien, THE MAZE RUNNER franchise) is brought into the tailor shop after being shot by a rival gang ambush. He's accompanied by Francis (Johnny Flynn, EMMA., 2020), and the dynamics between these two is quite interesting. Richie is the son of the Boyle family patriarch and has been seeing Mable on the side, while Francis is the favored employee after saving Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale) by taking gun fire. Richie is a whiny, spoiled wannabe tough guy, while Francis is volatile and constantly sneering.What follows is a bit Hitchcockian. We have plot twists, murder, backstabbing, danger, and surprises. When it's discovered the Boyle family has a rat that is feeding details to the rival cross-town gang and the FBI, things get tense thanks partially to a MacGuffin audio tape. It all leads to confrontations in the shop, and some nice scene-chewing from Simon Russell Beale and Nikki Amuka-Bird as the leader of the rival gang. An elaborate plan by one of the characters is a pleasant surprise (to us, not the others). As Leonard points out on a couple of occasions, he's a "cutter", not a tailor - a distinction he takes as seriously as his skill with shears. The film's title has double meaning: the suits Leonard crafts, and the national syndicate that involves the Boyle family. Most of this we've seen before, but it's Rylance's portrayal of Leonard that offers a different look and feel. Fans of deceptive thrillers will find some joy here.Opens in theaters on March 18, 2022.
ok The Outfit proves that you don't need a bunch of over paid actors and a huge budget to make a great film. A good script and solid acting works just as well. 7 stars.
good You don't see many movies like this in theatres these days! And this is exactly why I loved it, it's the kind of film that I really miss seeing a lot of; they type that typically gets dumped on streaming these days. It's an old-fashioned crime thriller that takes place in one location and is a dialogue driven story... and believe it or not it's not part of a franchise! It's a very well done film and is certainly going to be one of the most underrated films of 2022. If you're reading this, don't sleep on it, go see it right away! I didn't even watch a trailer for it, I went in pretty much blind, and absolutely loved it! I ate it right up; it was a huge, pleasant surprise! It's a perfect classic day-in-the-life of a mobster tale!Writer-director Graham Moore really brings a Hitchcock frame of mind to this film. It takes place all in one location, has a small cast and yet could not be more intense and impressive! The script is immaculate, one of the best crime thriller scripts I've seen in ages and feels like it actually has a high quality feel to it. There are so many awesome twists and turns throughout, and some truly electric dialogue. I also loved how it uses the concept of Chekhov's gun to cleverly setup and subvert expectations, it made the twists even more satisfying! Every time I thought I had the film figured out, it turned the tables on me, keeping me in suspense. Moore handles the suspense so well, in very Hitchcockian ways and the movie is constantly gripping, interesting and intense! However while the films abundance and reliance on its twists is its greatest strength, it's also its greatest flaw as it slightly pushed my suspension of disbelief a little far and messed with the pacing at times. But the pros far outweigh the cons. I also loved how cleverly Moore made use of the space (the tailor shop), which was immaculately and thoroughly utilized throughout. I was constantly surprised how they kept finding new ways to use the space and evolve the story! The only downside was that this didn't allow for the cinematography to be as impressive or eye popping as it could have been; it was good but not overly creative, just purely functional.Another huge strength of the film is it's impressive cast and stellar performances! Mark Rylance kills it in this movie, he delivers such a daring and phenomenal performance as Leonard. It's incredibly nuanced and I just love how he slowly revealed more about his character through ways he behaved and slight tendencies in dialogue delivery. The story also really helped here, I loved how it slowly pulled back the curtain on the character as the film went on, and you couldn't help but root for him. Zoey Deutch was also such a surprise, she was so good in this, and Dylan O'Brien and Johnny Flynn were also great and need to be in more stuff! All the acting in the film was incredible, it blew me away. The actors alongside the great script truly carry the film and are the reason I loved it as much as I did!The Outfit isn't flashy, but it's a very solid story with a tightly tailored performance from Mark Rylance. It's perfect for fans of old-school thrillers; it's very well made and very enjoyable. Don't miss this one, it's rare we get films as special as this one these days!
good This 'little' film very much has the feeling of a stage play. There is really only one set (the tailor Leonard's shop) in which everything happens. To go along with that, it has an almost claustrophobic atmosphere as the different Chicago gangster characters come and go, threaten Leonard and his receptionist Mable (nicely done by Zoey Deutch), argue, leave again. Leonard basically has to outwit them at every twist and turn (and there are lots of twists and turns), and that is about it for the plot. Add to that the fact that no one is entirely who they seem and we get a fascinating hour and a half of intense 'locked room' drama.I wouldn't quite call this minimalist ("Wating for Godot" would classify as minimalist in my books). It's continually absorbing and yet built out of nothing but carefully rendered dialog. Mark Rylance is as always superb, he somehow builds a character out of measured dialog and changes in expression that might not be anything more than a raised eyebrow or a tightening of the mouth. Amazing to watch.I first noticed Zoey Deutch in Before I Fall (2017) in which she was about the only standout. Nice to see that bigger and better roles are coming her way.Saying anything more at all would give away too much since The Outfit is, in part, a mystery as well as suspense drama. Just go see it!
ok Things that frequently describe movies I love: sci-fi, action, blockbuster, fast-paced, crazy and out-there, epic, superhero.Things that frequently describe movies I dislike: period piece, slow burn, mostly talking, artsy.I listed the above to illustrate how good of a movie this had to be in order for me to like it this much. I watched zero trailers and knew nothing going in. When it starts in 1956 with a man describing how to make clothes, I think "omg what have I gotten myself into." Halfway through I think "it's pretty good but not something I would revisit." By the end I think "it's awesome, rewatching is a must."This movie is clever on so many levels. It has character and class with lots of memorable moments. It has great scenes of suspense as well as good performances all around. And best of all, the story is so captivating and told in a... clever way. What a pleasant surprise. (1 viewing, 3/21/2022)SPOILERSBlue jeans. Lol.There were so many twists and turns. None of them blew my mind or gave me goosebumps. But every single one surprised me and made me smile.I also loved the parallel throughout the movie between makes clothes and making movies. I didn't notice the parallel until the final shot. I don't know if that's when the realization is meant to happen or if I'm just slow (if so, don't make fun of me lol). Either way I'm glad it happened that way for me, because it was a delicious cherry on top of a great movie).The only thing I wonder is if his plan was feasible or if it needed everything to go perfectly. I'll have to see on second viewing. But even if it's not perfect, it won't make me like the movie any less.
good An English tailor in Chicago makes a dime, stitching up a bespoke suit can take some time, with a trusty tape and thimble, his cutting sheers are nimble, several threads becoming frayed then intertwined.
ok I am a massive fan of single location movies. "Identity" or "Death And The Maiden" come to mind. The conceit typically makes the moviemakers get really clever with the use of space. But if you've seen enough movies about mild manner characters with simmering dark pasts, you'll see a lot of this coming from a mile out. Which will leave you wondering "why was the movie even made?"The writer/director is Graham Moore, who was most likely given this simple feature to make to show he can bridge his career into directing. This is a nice little flick that like the Wachowskis who made "Bound" means he can do something bigger. Perhaps not "The Matrix" but he will segue this into something much larger.The story is of a tailor...er cutter named Leonard Burling (Mark Rylance), a quiet Englishman who constructs the most exquisite suits in Chicago. We know this because of the way he speaks reverentially about his craft. His precision is that of a car engineer carving out clean lines, attention to detail, and near obsessive nature in which he narrates the work he is doing. It also illustrates the connection he makes between that and the people who wear the suits he makes.He is assisted by a very street tough girl, Mabel (Zoey Deutch) from the neighborhood who has long history with the block, enough to see that it has fallen to the scum of society. That doesn't stop her from dating the son of a very awful mob boss who has his eyes set on being included in a national network of other criminal scum. Leonard's store is being used as a drop off spot for communications between that interconnect villainy (the days before the Dark Web).Unfortunately, the local mob discover that there is a rat in their midst, and a tape that was discovered in the box contains the whereabouts and, therefore, identity of the snitch. There is some mob infighting and slowly, they begin to turn on one another.The movie itself, while expertly designed fails at the worst part possible...the reveal. It's no secret that still waters are going to run deep. And we are handed brief glimpses of the darkness within. Though, the frustrating part is having to wait for the pot to boil, it is also a grind to watch Mark Rylance savor his deadpan English darkness. Even when he is expressing any emotion. The audience will wonder if the man isn't brain dead at some points. Leonard is treated very poorly by the mob guys, but yet he remains still and silent...big clue he is about to get ugly. But that time never happens. Well, it kind of does, but by then, it comes off as very unsatisfying and exhausting.Now, going in, I knew there was going to be that titular scene of his love of making suits. This clearly had that in mind. Also, an Academy Award writer isn't going to slack on the details. However fascinating it is to see the making of a suit and the care and patience it takes to craft it, it is VERY tedious to sit through. At a certain point we want to scream "we get it, you did your research!" But that was a tough line to skate. Because it is filler to a rather empty plot throughout.I found myself disinterested in the why or how or whats and found myself just wanting it to have some tension. Again, if you've seen the tricks of how to raise the anxiety of a situation, none of this will come as a surprise.To me, a very lackluster endeavor, but above average for the care it took to attempt it.
good Leonard Burley (Mark Rylance) left London and opened up a shop making fine suits in Chicago as the film opens in 1956. The back room of the shop has a drop box used by the Boyle mob to collect money and pass along messages. The La Fontaines are a rival gang. Leonard's receptionist (Zoey Deutch daughter of Lea Thompson and Howard the Deutch) is the girlfriend of the mob boss's son.All the action takes place in the shop, making this an excellent play. I loved the writing which twists things away from the norm of Hollywood predictability. Enjoyable film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.
good . . . SLEUTH. Watching THE OUTFIT will help the cutting fraternity to bounce back from the overrated PHANTOM THREAD, as it shows why the typical Saville Row tailor shop is frequented by THE KRAYS and THE GODFATHER's, at least the first one. THE OUTFIT is not the sort of ludicrous eye candy represented by the KING'S MAN series. The only reference to a historical person is Al Capone, and how can you set a mob movie in Chicago without mentioning Big Al? Thankfully, the Alcatraz tax cheat is long gone by 1956, when this story takes place. This flick is perfectly paced, cast and plotted--all the twists are in the right places, and few viewers will foresee them all. THE OUTFIT is 2022's PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN.
good LIKES:The Atmosphere: This movie is all about establishing an imposing and suspenseful atmosphere in probably the lowest intensity ever. And you know what... it worked for me. The Outfit is a very vague premise from the title, but in it you find a very classy, and intense atmosphere that does not involve creatures, bombs, or intense fighting scenes. This film takes a much laid back, and organized manner, where the intensity is trying to find out what will happen, how things will wind up, and what lies beneath the surface. As you are waiting for these answers, the movie continues to take elements to increase the suspense, and make you invest in the much simpler piece this film is made.The Costumes: It's nothing like a Disney live action movie or a Harry Potter world, but the Outfit's clothes tell a story on their own at what goes on in this story. Much of the film takes place in a small shop fitted to making clothes, and the stories that they hold are very powerful. It's a mobster movie as you can see from the poster, but though they come from a similar cloth, each suit holds a power and character with it, helping to differentiate characters, and make a statement to the story. It works well to be honest and I was very happy with how things came out with it.The Culture: This movie is all about the cultural mindsets and stereotypes of two worlds coming together. One of course in the dark corners of the Mafia family, while the other is of a cutter who finds business with these people. The two worlds dance in an uneven tone, with each new member adding to the odd exchange in an attempt to keep the situation at hand. Seeing the class of the Cutter trying to navigate the unruly attitude of the Mob boys was super intriguing to watch. I loved seeing the values, morals, and mannerisms come out, again making a big world in such a small space, once again maximizing so much in a small amount of work.Decent Pacing of The Tale: For a tale with no action, the Outfit moves very well to my surprise. It's very easy to follow, twisting the plot and kinking the linear pace to feel engaging and interesting in the process. Each new act of the movie somehow painted a bit more of the mystery to solve, while also laying a new clue to help you connect the pieces. Story elements gradually drop as well, and this one night of intensity becomes a crock pot ready to blow with the pressure being seen. Very nice tactics to use for something with less action and moving.The Dialogue/Writing: By far the biggest character moments is in the writing of this film, particular the dialogue our cast has to recite. The Outfit's words are not poetic sonnets meant to be quote, one liner capable of being the next TikTok scene, or even those inspirational lines that we love seeing. No, it's again a very witty and classy exchange of words as the stories that are being cast are put to the test of agonizing scrutiny by very powerful people. Each line uttered is like a sword on itself, a fencing match of intelligence and presentation in hopes of convincing the other to reveal the secrets and truth at hand. It's that writing that is very fitting of the time, the age, and the characters, not being forced as the characteristics come out in big in full light to potentially reward or punish those at hand. It's again very smart writing, and I loved how so much was through the words rather than the actions.The Acting: By far the strongest aspect, is the acting that has to deliver the lines. Secondary characters do well for the limited time and involvement to make a believable member of the troop. However, the main characters are the ones that get a gold star in this role that really take the movie to the top. Dylan O'Brien is fine, his character a keystone piece to the drama, though his full-on screen time needed work. He manages to bring the arrogance and fire of a youthful mob son holds. He has the mouth, the cockiness, and the edge to deliver threats and he does well with the part, hitting new levels of quality that I had not expected. Zoey Deutch is lovely as always, a role that brings out the usual innocence she has in her characters, but soon she brings her own edge to the mix. She's confident, she can face the group, but there is a vulnerability there too as she was forced into the game. I loved her chemistry with the characters a lot, and she really made a great bridge character to the group. As for Mark Rylance, wow... he was incredible as he always is in his roles. The class I've been talking about is held in his character on so many levels. From the way he presents his world to the posture he holds, there is just an heir of top-level character melding that Rylance obtained in his field. It was like he and Leonard were one and the same, making a believable performance that this movie heavily depended on, given the screen time he held. A strong character and a performance to match, he may be the strongest aspect of this film.DISLIKES:The Short Screen Time of Several Characters: As I said, Rylance holds much of the screen time, while a lot of other characters spend a shocking amount of time off screen. The Outfit is able to bring the absence into a more story-oriented use, but I can't help but feel robbed of the other cast members' performances by them being gone for so long. More integration was needed for these groups, and I had liked more time with the other cast members to get the full involvement in the story.Why Other Parts of The City Could Not Be Seen: As I said, the dialogue is super important to the story, as not only does it have to craft the characteristics, but also tells you what is happening in the world around them. Much of the film is cleverly taking place in this shop, but there is a lot happening in the streets of Chicago as well, and the world we could have inhabited. I'm not saying we needed to be running through the streets and ducking the gang fights, but I can say a little time outside of the shop would have done wonders for the film. Some of those characters that disappear from the screen, are out on those streets and getting to see these moments come out would have been nice at times.The Background Info Is Bland: For most characters, there are potentially some juicy origin stories to dive into, particularly in the darkness they hold. However, The Outfit's stories are rather mediocre for my tastes, and even the ones with more meat did not quite get the full body presentation I think they wanted. Maybe it was in the interest of time, or maybe it was trying to take the artistic direction, but there was more for me that could have been delivered to really give the full twist to the mix.The "Climactic" Finish: The one thing in this movie that felt off, was the final moment that felt like it was just in the wrong moment for this film. I liked seeing the last few parts of the character come to light and prove my theory, but this part seemed to just not fit into the pace of the rest of the movie. Even worse, this wrench in the gears really did not have impressive choreography or even really any tension, because most of the intensity had fled at this time. It felt like a last-minute attempt to interject some suspense and get the movie to over the 90-minute mark, but again it just did not feel needed.The VERDICT:The Outfit turned out to be a nice surprise in terms of the crime and drama element themes that the IMDB page promised. It's definitely not the usual gang busting, speed chasing, and bank robbing moment that we often get. No, instead, it's something with a lot more character development to it, using the subtle art of acting and good writing to tell the tale, rather than drown us in expensive scenes. The Outfit feels like a movie with a modern Shakespearean approach, and though the language is not as artsy, the presentation and intelligence are high for this film's writing making it the mightier pen of the crime and drama genres. However, the movie still could have used some doctoring up, trying to tie in more of the world and extend the world of the historical Chicago where so much happened. In addition, more characters needed to stay on screen helping further develop the information of their group, and maybe put more suspense into the film with the heated moods they took. Of course, the movie's end scene could have been different, and without the other scenes of action to support it, is a rather obscure finale to what was a calmer movie.My scores are:Crime/Drama: 8.0Movie Overall: 7.0.
ok The Outfit makes up for its few flaws with snappy dialogue, intriguingly layered characters, and some truly satisfying thrills and unexpected twists.Certain bits of conversation will reveal quirks and backgrounds for every character, and it makes it easy to rally behind any one of them, in spite of their tangible flaws. The writing in this department is truly worthy of the highest praise.The film's concluding twists reach quite a bit too far, requiring some logical leaps, mostly because they imply that some characters knew and predicted things that left far too much to chance.But even though the story does stumble at the end, I was amazed at how engaged I was throughout the entire rest of the film, despite the whole thing taking place in three rooms. It's a pretty impressive addition to the tired gangster genre.
good In our current world of CGI, over-the-top not believable action and shallow performances, this is a very entertaining cerebral movie. Lot of surprises you never saw coming. Mark Ryland is just so much fun to watch with his you-never-know-how-or-what-he's-going-to-say deliveries. Someone said it earlier, this would be a fantastic theater production.
ok First off, I didn't hate this movie but anything above a 6 is questionable.It felt like an ending searching for a story line to get it there. Mark Rylance acting was great to watch, the rest of the cast acted to support his character and were weak in doing so. The mobsters were unrealistic and didn't convince me that they would believe everything a tailor, regardless of of how good he is, told them. And when he stuttered around telling the boss that his son was killed by one of his own people while the killer held a gun to the girls (Zoey Deutch) head in full view without question was odd and never challenged.To get something else out of the way, he was a tailor not just a cutter. A cutter fits, measures the customer and cuts the cloth. The tailor sews and styles the suit. He did both, this is a tailor's job. So that fell flat and sounded disingenuous every time he corrected them.For the receptionist to pick up the story the tailor was telling and continue it also felt like manipulated writing and came across as shallow and lazy story telling. Many of the twists were unsurprising and not needed. The last 10 minutes should have been cut. Getting stabbed by a tailors shears that deep in the neck would and should have been the end. Not even sure why he burned his shop down.I gave it a 6 for the same reason others gave it a 8 or 9, I'm starving for half decent movies that aren't centred around super powers, magic or a cartoon. Just good old fashioned clever story telling. This should have been that movie, it wasn't.
ok "The Outfit" is posed punctiliously as a neo-noir, with specific elements of drama added in just to spice things up. From a story perspective though, there's nothing unique to be found here. It's another of those 'Single Location Thrillers' that Hollywood's been vigorously trotting out in the past couple of months.A group of good & bad people, a handful of conflicts and a Big Twist in the end; It's all so formulaic and fraught with well-recognised tropes. Now, there's nothing wrong in seeking proven recipes; besides, if you take a deeper glance at the fundamentals, there's only so much space for one's own modifications and adjustments. Hence, everything comes down to the presentation, and how the director envisions it. Although, I'm afraid the film doesn't do plentiful in that regard as well.Except for the great performances (Especially from Sir Mark Rylance) and a neat production layout (art direction, sets, costumes et cetera); there's not much else to it. And I'm quite certain that while watching the movie, many people would find uncanny similarities to some other movies in the genre and to be very honest, I couldn't blame them. We have seen it all, didn't we?
ok Well the art of acting main actor rylance can, calm and eloquently perfecsionism to the fingertip, both dialouges and an outfitters craftmanship. Its a complex cat and mouse game in the middle of chicagoes crime underworld, where the last mans laugh is the best.Its a story that would as well have fitted in on the theater stage as on the screen, it a one location act, a savile row kinda outfit shop, where the spoken will stay behind these walls as well as its a messengers hotspot among the big bosses of the underworld.Its a film with caracter, a film with a lot of wit, and a film that wont offer too much thrill and violence,and made on a balanced budget without exceeding ones expectations of a story like this financially, its more like a classic crime drama written in the start of the 20th century, but it still works.A small cast, apart from rylance and ms deutch, that doesnt disappoint at all. So the grumpy old man opened his matine' with ''the outfit'' before dressing up n' eatin breakfast, so now im hungry and ready for more from mr rylance, he has become one of my favourite caracter actors of the 2020's, therefore a recommend.
ok Harks back to an age when movies were different and even audiences were different. Excellent for what it does with what it has. Whether modern filmgoers will be satisfied, however, is another matter entirely.
ok I kind of liked it but it felt like a village hall amateur dramatic stage play; even down to the closed curtains and fake police car sirens going past. Lots of twists which were a bit convoluted. The acting was a bit am-dram too.
good Whatta film!'The Outfit' is excellent. Second time in roughly three weeks that I've had the pleasure of seeing a Mark Rylance flick on the big screen and again he delivers - such a reliable actor. The other release was 'The Phantom of the Open', which is very good but both the film and Rylance's performance is bettered here. A thoroughly enjoyable showing from him as Leonard Burling.Things start off extremely strongly with a terrific opening scene with Rylance's Burling, so I was praying that it would keep that high level and I'm pleased to say that - in my opinion, of course - it absolutely did. There's a bit at the end that I was initially unsure about, though upon further thought I enjoyed it just as much as the rest.One element of this 2022 production actually stays the same from start-to-finish, I won't say what but early on I thought it may limit proceedings but if anything it just adds to the overall vibe of it all. The support cast, meanwhile, are all faces I didn't know before now, though every one of them give good performances - standouts being Johnny Flynn and Nikki Amuka-Bird.
good When an expert tailor gets mixed up in some mob business he must use his wit's to survive the night.I went into this film blind, the only thing I knew was the synopsis and I throughly enjoyed it. The film does an amazing job of constantly surprising you, every time you think you have it figured out it throws another curve ball. This is what keeps you intrigued throughout the film as you are constantly trying to guess what will happen next. Although most of the time the twists are done very well and they make sense there are a few that I feel were unneeded.Mark Rylance is great as the lead character but I do feel there needed to be some more development for his character at the beginning. His characters development is there but it doesn't come until later. That being said it doesn't take too much away from his character as you will still find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. Dylan O'Obrien, Zoey Deutch, Johnny Flynn we're all great in their respective roles.The entire film takes place in one setting and the director Graham Moore does an amazing job of using this setting to his advantage. Every time your attention is drawn to something it is used later and he does this wonderfully.Overall this is a great film with terrific direction and storytelling you will be kept on the edge of your seat throughout the film. With great performances and intriguing characters "The Outfit" will make audiences happy they went to the movies.8/10.
ok Starts out slow and unassuming. Nothing much happens at first. Is this another boring movie? No way.The good: excellent acting performances. And a truly surprising and original story, which I did not see coming. Lots of twists that spun my mind. Really enticing to watch, with a shocking final.Any bad? One has got to have the patience to bridge the first minutes of this movie, because at first looks this movie might seem a bit slow and even a bit boring, but that doesnt make it less intrigueing and surprising.The story: a gentleman tailor is pressed by the mob, to hide an important briefcase in his premises. What is in it? And what dangers will come of keeping it?
bad This is an ok film if you turn off your brain for a while. Since the first few interactions it's mostly an easy movie to predict and then everyone just becomes open to manipulate, almost as if they are children. It gets old fast and I was hoping for more of a thriller type movie.Towards the end of the movie it gets even worse. You can't leave because of this, oh yeah but what about this, then this. Ok you're right. The screen writer wrote it backwards, finding an ending he wanted and then had every character written to get to said ending without thinking of logic or motivation. Some dialogue is frustratingly bad.Then the mandatory twist ending is just garbage. If any of the reviewers were asked why they thought it's a 10/10 movie, most will say because it's different. It's basically a one room play nothing more.
good This is one of the best damn movies I've seen in a while. Expertly crafted, very well acted, with phenomenal writing. I can't praise this movie enough, it's no Godfather but for 2022 it's the best movie in years. The tenseness alone you could cut with a knife. It's almost as heavy as No Country for Old Men, and that's high praise. An excellent period piece with all the makings of a classic. Rylance and company sell this tale with ease from one line to the next. Keeps you guessing all the way through just as any good tale should. It's a damn near perfect film. Only left me wanting more. Please make an effort to see it!
good Just saw it at the Berlinale and it's a very entertaining little piece of art where every detail is in the right place (or not in the right place if it needs to be) so it's really like the perfect Mystery movie, playing out with a lot of surprising twists and a slow, powerful pace without confusing or betraying the audience. Perfect, subtile acting of the whole cast. Great visual Ideas and a bit of spicy suspense and violence. It's quite so perfect, that it's funny to hear a voice over philosophy about dealing with imperfectionism during the finale of the movie. I am looking forward to see more of the director.
good The cutting and sewing scenes are a visual delight, even more so in their accuracy; they will make you think about the quiet obsession for perfection of Phantom Thread. On this precise framework director Graham Moore cuts a bespoke story woven around a sparse yet powerful cast, in a carefully mastered whodunnit that keeps the pressure steady on to its crescendo until the final release. The mise en scene keeps the focus on the actors' dialogues, and probably pays tribute to Hitchcock's Rope, but never resulting forced. Mark Rylance plays the tailor, pardon the cutter, with a controlled aloofness, but lets shine a twinkle of inner turmoil in his eyes and the sharpness of his wit, cutting himself loose from the situation he finds himself in. Probably one of the films I've enjoyed the most so far this year.
ok Quirky, yes, Original, it had some moments, good..... I'm not too sure on that one, it had some elements that were good, but far too many eye rolling moments, too many things that just didn't hang together.The acting was alright, Eddie Marsan was good as always, but efforts to make us think the characters were American, and in The US, just fell flat. Had they spoken naturally, and just set it in The UK, it may have worked better.The behaviour of the characters was just somehow really odd, hard to imagine anyone having such bizarre experiences, and carrying on normally.Favourite scenes, the cafe scene was bonkers, but worked well, the part with the rat in the house also good.Odd, not terrible, but should have been so much better.5/10.
ok It's one of those movies that falls into the mediocracy area pretty quickly. The acting is ok (Eddie Marsan is the stand-out as always) but the plot is just tired, old and predictable.It's not a movie I'd explicitly pay to watch but if it appears on your favorite streaming service(s) give it a watch while you do something else.
bad When computer programmer Kayla (Iola Evans) copies an old computer adventure game to her laptop, stuff happens.My favourite part of Choose or Die was when the soon-to-be-dead friend turns into a glitchy video image and starts to spew up videotape. My second favourite part was the giant rat attack, told entirely via monochromatic computer sprites. I didn't understand why either scene was happening, but they made me laugh (especially when the videotape was rewound and played forwards again).To be honest, I didn't have a clue what was going on for the majority of this lamentable retro, hipster mix of The Ring and Brainscan. I didn't understand the origin of the game or the rules behind its curse. Stuff just happens, and, for the most part, it's not very interesting stuff. People die, but they do so in the most unimaginative and gore-free fashion (whatever way is the cheapest to film). I wasn't invested in any of the characters, so I didn't really care what happened to them.The final scene makes it clear that a sequel could happen. I think I'll choose not to watch it.
ok This horror film opens with Hal, a middle aged man, finding a cassette that contains a 1980s computer game called 'CURS>R'. He has an old computer so decides to play. It is a text based adventure game. As soon as it starts something odd happens; his choices in the game play out in real life. He can only stop playing if he makes copies of the game; he does so. Three months later protagonist Kayla finds the game along with a note stating that the first person to beat it will win $125,000 and a phone number, which gives a recorded message suggesting it might be unclaimed. Her friend, computer programmer Isaac, helps her start to play. Again her in game choices have real world consequences; attempts to stop playing or destroy the tape don't work; if she tries to avoid making a choice it tells her to 'Choose or Die'! Things will get increasingly unpleasant as Kayla learns more about the game and its origins before inevitably facing 'The Boss' level.This film opened well; anybody who played a computer game will enjoy hearing the sound of a game loading off a cassette nostalgia inducing. The way the game affected real life might not have been entirely original it was enjoyable. Some of these were pretty disturbing but at other times we just see old style game animation while hearing what is meant to be happening which was less scary... although I guess it saved on the effects budget. The story progresses well enough with Kayla taking on the various levels of the game at the same time each day and worrying about what to do in between. The cast is solid. Talking of the cast; given that they are mostly British and it was filmed in London there is no logical explanation of their characters being American and setting it in the US. It was fun having Robert Englund, of 'Nightmare on Elm Street' fame provide the voice of the game's 'Director Terror'. Overall I thought this was okay; hardly a must watch but it passed the time well enough.
ok Choose or Die is about an unemployed programmer struggling to get by while looking after her sick mother when her and her 1980s obsessed friend discover an unheard of 80s video game that is much more than it seems. One of those old green and black choose your adventure games becomes very real as its not just a game, the decisions made affect the real world, she must make a choice, or die. The girl has to keep playing while she also tries to discover the origins of the game and how to stop it.Robert England only provides his voice to an answering machine and parts of the game, so don't expect to see him on screen.Overall, compared to some reviews here, it's not a bad movie, but it's not one I'll ever check out again. It's not so much a nostalgic thing, melleniul or boring as some other reviews stated. It just is what it is. It's not really horror unless you have a fear of video games coming to life, it's more of a bit of a thriller and investigation with a few deaths along the way. It is what it is.Like I said, it's pretty much just a one off viewing kinda thing, but certainly not a must see. You choose if you wanna see it? Either way, you won't die lol.
bad Is it really what I think it is? Filmed in the U. K with U. K. actors Playing Americans in America in the U. K.!Why could they not be British characters?
ok An inventive but ultimately disappointing horror movie. Choose Or Die has some nice moments and the final third is better than what has come before but it is choppy in places and never really gels. A smart little voice cameo from Robert Englund and Iola Evans & Asa Butterfield are likeable enough leads but the movie just feels rushed. Could have been so much better.
ok All it takes to get millennials' attention is the mere mention of retro-gaming. When that forms the core concept of a horror-thriller, it obviously piqued my interest. The inclusion of Asa Butterfield in a prominent role also raised the stakes a little. But nope, the film is as bad as its poster looks. A B-horror movie that boasts a few outlandish frames thanks to its video-game context, there's not a lot to recommend here. The plot is absurd but that'd have been okay if the film stuck to its wackiness all through, say like Bandersnatch. Here, it shuffles between the real world and the video-game world, at times undermining the consequences that take place in the former. Like, the protagonist's mom is in the hospital nearly dead with an absolute creep for a bystander, and she's more concerned about the "prize money"? Okay then! Also, instead of focusing on the scares and thrills, the film goes the expository route. ðŸ‘Ž
ok I believe it would have been an interesting short film about retro game that takes over control and forces you to make awful choices.However, the movie falls short with a regular length runtime and proves to be a drag devoid of any real excitement. As many before mentioned, it's just plain boring.Leading duo does a decent job but underdeveloped script gives them little to work with.Almost impossible to get through in one sitting.Would have rather avoided it.4 out of 10 from me.
ok The first 43 minutes of this originally done Horror flick was easily 10/10 & then it started to go down hill so I'm conflicted with the score to rate this movie ðŸŽ¬ because the first half was so good I'll give it 7/10 It's definitely worth the watch because the start of this movie was insanely cool!
ok It's not really scary, but it's entertaining with its really good moments.It has the right balance of the older nostalgic effects as well. The ending is a bit weak, especially compared to how strong the start is. Worth a watch, but not with high hopes since it does have themes seen in other horror films. So it's not the most original, but it's fun to watch if you are a horror fan.The overall plot isn't the most in depth, but it works. The acting is decent enough too. I've seen much worse.
ok I love a good, messed horror with games involved. It's no Saw or Spiral, but it really hits the spot. It held my interest right from the start and I have the attention span of a 2 year old. The length was perfect. Honestly I could have watched more and if there was a sequel I won't not be mad!!
bad Another bomb from Netflix, confusing and not in a good way. Some very questionable acting, I cut my losses and bailed at the 30 minute mark, Netflix collects so much revenue yet continues to produce trash like this. Then will go and invest hundreds of millions in shows like Stranger Things, some consistency lacking there.
ok Kayla Edwards (Iola Evans) is a college programming student living paycheck to paycheck as a window cleaner and caring for her drug addicted mother, Thea (Angela Griffin). On the side, Kayla restores old technology for her friend, Isaac (Asa Butterfield), who specializes in coding and old computer programming. When Kayla comes across a copy of old 80s computer game CURS>R in Isaac's collection, she decides to play the game for a chance at possibly winning unclaimed prize money related to the game. However when Kayla plays the game, CURS>R's choices have real world consequences and in order to survive Kayla will have to choose or die.Choose or Die began life under the title Curser (spelled CURS>R) back in 2019. When it was first announced, the project was envisioned as a "short form" series for the ill-fated Quibi streaming service that folded less than a year after its launch with Ridley Scott serving as a producer through his Scott Free label. When Quibi folded so too did this incarnation of the project, but while Ridley Scott dropped out as a producer, UK company Anton relaunched the project as a traditional feature film with director Toby Meakins and writer Simon Allen still involved. The film marks Meakins' first feature debut, as well as the first feature writing credit of Allen who's better known for his TV work such as BBC's The Watch or The Musketeers. Choose or Die has an interesting premise on the surface, but underneath its initial hook this is a bare basics rehash of those post 2002 The Ring "cursed object" movies you've seen only with unintentional hilarity.When I'd heard about the premise for this film revolving around a cursed 80s text based adventure game, I was reasonably optimistic about the premise as I'd seen the concept done before in the episodic horror game Untold Stories where a play plays a text based adventure game that suddenly turns into a dark reflection of a past wrong they committed. Unfortunately that's where the comparisons end because the movie doesn't have characters who are all that interesting and are given the bare minimum as place holders to go through most of the same beats you've seen in movies like Polaroid, Countdown, Friend Request, and every other horror movie of the past 5 years you probably forgot existed. But Choose or Die stands out a little from those movies as it goes beyond being generic and into unintentional comedy.The first "choose or die" set piece where Kayla inadvertently causes an unsuspecting waitress to commit suicide by eating glass is somewhat unnerving, but every subsequent set piece beyond the first one amps up the ridiculousness beginning with a sequence where the game creates a giant rat that terrorizes Kayla's mother Thea in their apartment, but we don't actually see this rat as instead the sequence is shown to us with pixelated black and green graphics complete with MIDI music that makes a scene that should be horrifying gut bustlingly funny. And it only gets worse from there as poor Asa Butterfield reaches a low point in his career where he acts out a scene regurgitating unspooled Betamax tape in fast forward. But the absolute cherry on top comes from the very end of the movie where you'll be fully aware this was once intended to be a Quibi series because it sets up continuation in a way that positions it for a genre switch from horror to superhero.... I'm not joking.Choose or Die on the surface seems like yet another rehash of the cursed object formula, but it goes beyond simply being generic and can't be taken even the slightest bit seriously thanks to ill judged scenes that make something that should be horrifying instead humorous. The bland cast are feebly trying to bring some credibility to this material, but it's a fools errand as the premise gets more and more deranged culminating in an ending that feels like a remnant from when this was envisioned as a Quibi series.
bad The first half of the movie is great. Good premise, interesting idea and some nostalgia from the 80's well executed.But then, suddenly the movie sinks by itself. Extremely poor acting showed up including weird situations, annoying music, and the lame ending. What a conclusion. Terrible.Overall a wasted opportunity. Game over.
ok Pretty solid film all in all. Good cast and plot. It reminded me of a mixture of 13 sins and escape room to some extent. I liked that it had an ambiguous ending, though I feel this film would be better as just a standalone. We also have robert englands voice in the mix which was good though wish we actually saw him. Altogether a well acted horror movie. Maybe one of netflixes best in recent years.
ok Watched this last night in the hope that Netflix had added a good new horror film for me to watch, well they didn't exactly, in fact I thought the film was just okay.What did it have going for it, well the story was okay, it's been done before of course, the acting was borderline with the movie but of course parts of the film showed how cheap it was.Pros: as stated above and also not much more than what I have stated.Cons: there is way to much but a lot of reviewers have also stated such as, the music, putting loud rap music and synth music over the film just shows that the director doesn't know how to do tension, in fact this film was less than a horror film. There was no tension in it, no jump scares. So if they do a sequel stop with the over music it takes away any tension that is in the movie.Also the sub plot with the druggie, was awful and pointless, this bit was stupid.I struggled to give this film a four star rating, I was going to give a three but I did enjoy it and glad it wasn't on for a long time, so for that a four star rating.
ok I gave it 5 stars as a pity move. It's a pretty bad movie. Derivative, done to death, and cheesy.I mean, they tried. They even got a cameo from Freddy himself, Robert Englund. That's just not enough. The lead actress seems ernest and is trying. The faults lie entirely with the lazy writing, crappy sfx, and the predictability of damn near every single scene.
ok I liked the nostalgia with the 80s tech pull, and the homage to Ring/Ringu mixed with Black Mirror feel.Not scary, but entertaining. There's a 1 Hour Photo feel, characters and the background color schemes matching/blending, that's pretty cool. Soundtrack is solid, acting decent.Not sure if it's rewatchable, but I enjoyed the 85 mins for what it was, popcorn flick with friends.
ok I read a lot of negative reviews for this movie, but it's deserves some credit for originality of the storyline.It's a very low budget movie, there are virtually zero special effects. And maybe this is why some people are disappointed I don't know.But for this reason, I think the movie deserves some kudos. The storyline is original and for a 90 minute movie, it's does keep you engaged until the end. There are a couple of gruesome moments, but it is not a heavy horror or gory film. I'd say it's really more borderline sci-fi thriller. Again, maybe people were expecting more here.I'd really give this movie a 6/10, but I think for a low budget movie I think it's entertaining.Basically, I'd expect to see this movie, at a low-budget, 2-day horror film festival.For a Netflix movie, I'd expect bigger/budget production. Overall, it is different and watchable.
ok If you are looking to get scared as hell, forget about it, its not that scary, pretty much predictable but I like the concept, its unique and fresh. The plot could have been explained better if this would have been directed by James wan but its a good film to watch. Just don't expect too much, save it for when you have nothing to watch.
ok I am shocked this is getting such poor ratings!It was a bit like a long Black Mirror episode and it did require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but isn't that sometimes what sci-fi entertainment is all about? I grew up loving Eerie Indiana and Goosebumps etc so anything that falls into that sort of category is always a win for me; this was pretty much a grown up R L Stein story.Main point: Angela Griffin was amazing - absolutely her best performance, shame she didn't have a bit more screen time. It took me ages to realise it was her.Please give it a watch and just enjoy a silly, gory story with some great performances.
ok There was a missed opportunity to make this an interactive movie. It would've been better if the audience got to choose the options, changing the outcome of the movie being watched. Wish more time was spent on character development.I do like the ending, it reminds me a bit of deathnote - using this curse against criminals. Outside of that, not a great movie. If looking for a quick watch, turn it on but don't expect anything stellar.
bad Just bad... Boring. And I'm one for giving slow moving films a chance, as I grew up in the 70's where films moved much slower than the films of today, but - a great film will hold your attention even still. THIS film is just silly, stupid, and has no real hook or story worth paying attention to.Avoid at all costs, if you actually value your time.
good Watch the movie and ignore the bad reviews.. It's nicely told story with edge of seat suspense..
ok Don't come into this expecting nonstop action and thrills. What we have here is a ponderous, character-driven Cold War style espionage film that takes it time telling its intriguing story and has a satisfying payoff.I was happy that some of the twists have much more depth than at initial glance and feel more natural than a lot of shock value storytelling. Pine and Newton do most of the heavy lifting and fit their roles well. Pine gives off some serious elder Brosnan vibes here and I'm here for it. The story ends up being quite heartfelt and bypasses most of the cliches that plague the genre.The people complaining about how confusing it is clearly did not pay attention because every prior moment of intrigue is explained by the end.
good This spy thriller is more about spy-relationships with hardly any thrills. It's a very slow burn, and I can see how many would become impatient. I'm also not a fan of timeline back and forths, and this has many, and more than just two timelines. However, although not perfect, the timelines are what kept me intrigued to continue to watch, as they revealed small pieces of the puzzle throughout. The reward at the end is worth it imo, I just wish the felt-longer 101 min runtime with slow pacing had been shorter and faster. Huge credit goes to Pine and Newton for their exceptional performances, and another reason why I didn't throw in the towel mid-way, plus adding Fishburne and Pryce into the mix was a bonus. So if you don't go into this expecting a James Bond action spy thriller, and have the patience, you may enjoy it once it reaches the end. All the Old Knives had sharp performances, but the story-telling was dull and needed much sharpening. It's a 7.5 rounded up to an 8/10 from me.
ok Definitely a 7 or more. Right now showing a 6 is very underated. Great acting by both Newton and Pine. Keeps you interested throughout. I'd recommend for sure.
good Flashbacks are numerous but easy to follow because the characters look markedly different. Good spy thriller with stellar acting and a couple of good, though expected twists that will still keep you guessing until the final revelation. There is zero action so look elsewhere if you're looking for a Bond escapade. Nice direction, cinematography and despite the slow pace, never boring. Pine, Newton and Pryce do some nice work here. Highly recommended!!!
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Thanks to James Bond, Jason Bourne, and Ethan Hunt, we've grown accustomed to globetrotting action-packed thrillers in the spy genre. But of course, there is the flip side: the quiet and unheralded work done by intelligence agents ... those who typically use their brains more often than their fists or guns. Director Janus Metz (the underrated BORG VS MCENROE, 2017) has based his film on the 2015 book by Olen Steinhauer.It's 2012 and we are inside the Vienna station of the CIA as the agents meet to strategize their response to a terrorist act - the hijacking of Turkish Alliance Airline Flight 127. The team is unable to prevent tragedy, and it's clear this is a case that will stick with them. Eight years later, the station chief (Laurence Fishburne) calls Henry Pelham (Chris Pine) back in to let him know that on orders from Langley the case has been re-opened. The terrorist behind that hijacking has been recently captured and disclosed that he had a CIA mole inside the Vienna station. Henry is to re-interview everyone involved to uncover the double-agent.One of those interviewed is the former supervisor played by Jonathan Pryce. He's now retired, and Henry forces him to go back through all details, some of which are uncomfortably personal. But that doesn't compare to how personal the next interview hits. Celia (Thandiwe Newton) was not just Henry's fellow agent, but also his lover. She has since left the agency and is living a pleasant family life in stunning Carmel-by-the-Sea, perhaps the most picturesque coastal area in the U. S. Chris Pine gets to look really cool driving a convertible over Bixby Bridge.Director Metz works in numerous flashbacks to the relationship between Henry and Celia, and it's through these that we come to understand their connection and the type of people they are. But ultimately, it's their meeting at the fancy restaurant with the breathtaking view that serves as the key to the movie and the story. In fact, because their time sharing a table and wine is so substantial and critical, it could easily transition to a stage play. It's a high-level game of cat-and-mouse between two beautiful and smart characters. You may know where it's headed, but it's unlikely you'll know how it will get there.It's easy to see this being a popular streaming choice as the characters and setting are easy on the eyes. The deeper questions asked here are what to do when a loved one isn't who you thought they were. Also, can you trust those trained to not trust others? As previously stated, it's a bit of a different spin on the spy genre - less action/thriller and more character study.Streaming on Prime Video beginning April 8, 2022.
ok Slow boil thriller. Moves at a deliberate pace over two timelines. A solid cast and story. Just as things get predictable, a third act plot twist adds to the story intrigue.
good Bottom line is that All the Old Knives is a really fine and absorbing movie. I recommend it, no hesitation. The rest of what I have to say about it just fills in details.Spy thrillers on the screen seem to fall into two categories. The first and by far the most numerous is the James Bond path: fill the screen with action and when in doubt, add in more car chases, hand-to-hand fights, and explosions. These efforts can be extremely well done and give you a great thrill ride and if that's what you want, there's no lack of choices out there. But the generic problem with those was nicely nailed by that very wise writer Ursula Le Guin: if the only thing going on is unceasing physical action, that's a sure sign no story is being told. (Or words to that effect -- I had trouble finding the exact quote.)So then we have the second category: the John LeCarre camp. Much rarer and ultimately more interesting. Sylistically the daddy of all of these is The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965, starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom). All the Old Knives is spookily close to a modern version of that. Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton play now-retired intelligence officers tasked with getting to the bottom of an 8-year-old unsolved mystery: what went wrong with the way their agency dealt with the infamous Flight 127 in Vienna, taken over and destroyed by terrorists? Was their a mole among them, and who? The story gets laid out for us in flashbacks and replays of their memories (and sometimes flashbacks within the flashbacks), bit by bit.Here's a spoiler for free: there's not a SINGLE car chase, fight, or explosion. Not one. (There is one gunshot.) This is grittier, realer, and tenser. If you think this is boring -- here, have a lollipop. Go away and let the grownups watch it.The two stars Pine and Newton virtually carry the whole movie, with a bit of help from veterans Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Pryce in supporting roles. But they are all excellent and the dialog is impressively realistic, constantly engaging. Following the twists and turns is not meant to be easy, I think, but the scenes connect seamlessly and flow beautifully. Is there a message underneath it all? It's never said out loud, but I think it is just that in this spy business, everybody taking part -- sooner or later, right side or wrong side -- loses. Be prepared to have a mix of feelings by the end.
good Solid noir/espionage story: once again, I am not a big fan of repeated flashbacks but this time it had a point as they unfold along with the investigation (side note: Newton is as perfect as always).
ok The movie has all the good accessories: sleek production, atmospheric mise-en-scene, glossy photography, powerful soundtrack.But it's the excellent screenplay (from author Olen Steinhauer) and acting performances that make All The Old Knives a high quality espionage thriller, one made of the good old stuff.For once the genre is not represented in movies by the usual kiss-kiss bang-bang, car chases, fistfights and the whole James Bond enchilada. This is espionage for connoisseurs.
ok Where the complicated strings of life in the shadowlands of spying at each other, ultimately leads to the fall of a king or chessmate or chest mate and good night...an unusual tight , extremely dusk, grey and dark spythriller, not as action filled as ''spy games'', but eventually pretty decent try on a genre that hasnt been overflowing the market lately. Its got pieces and bits of material from 70 and 80's classics, like ''sting'' and ''the mole'', and the story is pretty tense to follow.A bit slow on plot speed, and some lack on prescicionediting, its overflowed with decent filmatographic and dramaturgic cleverness, and the surprises never seems to end. A bit dull is the musical score, and the acting never reaches the upper cut, but entertaining it is. So without blood and gore and heavy shootouts, the grumpy old man recommends this kinda spy chess.
ok Here we have another streaming movie that stinks of direct-to-video quality. It's extremely boring with 95% of the movie being conversations between two characters. It's listed as a thriller which is a huge lie. This is a mystery which is somewhat predictable. And much of it doesn't make sense if you think about it for more than a second.This movie isn't horrible. I was somewhat intrigued and I like the cast. But this is another streaming movie snoozer. (1 viewing, 4/10/2022)SPOILERSI guessed that he was the mole so early, when he asked to be the one to do the interrogation. But it was a throwaway guess that I forgot about until the middle of the movie when someone says "it could be you." At that point I remembered my original prediction and was sure of it.At least that's only the first of three twists. The second one was surprising but, when you think about it, makes no sense. They said that two different people corroborated that he's the mole and "that's good enough for me." They said that Elyas gave up his name. So why this whole elaborate reverse-interrogation plan? She says it's for confirmation... but they already poisoned the wine. So I ask again, why go through this whole ordeal? And what if he knew it was a sham and ran? Or did something crazy like... oh I dunno, hire a hitman to kill Celia... which he did. It's really dumb.The last twist about him doing it to save her was pretty cool, but at that point I had basically given up on the movie.
ok All the Old Knives is a film you watch when you're scrolling through the channels and nothing is on. The R-rating is strictly for the sex scenes, which were unnecessary, because this film calls upon the viewer's imagination with many plot elements implied so spelling out those scenes in detail is contradictory to the approach of telling the story. The screenplay and novel author Olen Steinhauer is also responsible for the fantastic series Berlin Station and if the author had more time and money to produce a longer film(maybe 3 more hours) All the Old Knives might have been a better production. All the Old Knives is average, middle of the road, meh, but.....if you truly want a better experience, pay strict close attention to all the characters and the small elements that are introduced throughout the film - which are many.
bad When you see the Amazon Original logo on a movie, it usually serves a warning. You're going to get a slow moving film with lots of slow panning camera shots, cinematography ridden with lens flares, mist filter lighting and lots of closeups of the actor's faces with the rest of the scene blurred out in the background.For once though, at least the color grading was nice.The movie starts off somewhat intriguing, mostly due to Chris Pine, who seems to have prematurely entered the Neeson / Travolta Geezer teaser phase of his career after a few high profile misfires. But the plot quickly unravels as the narrative loses focus and becomes bogged down in cell phone records and endless flashbacks to the two main character's relationship. This is the core of the story, and it's supposed to lay the groundwork for the big reveal at the end, but the two leads have little to no chemistry, the love scenes and romance has no spark, and therefore the entire emotional core of the story falls apart.As the plot meanders on from flashback to flashback, it becomes more and more ludicrous. Never mind that the CIA would never allow lovers working in the field like this, no one except Laurence Fishbourne feels like a CIA agent. The side characters are just window dressing with the exception of Johnathan Pryce, who get show off his acting chops in one scene.The response to the hijackers is ludicrous, as is the entire story about how the Germans or Austrians don't want to release 5 prisoners. Ridiculous. Neither of these countries would risk a plane full of people being killed on the internet over 5 prisoners they could easily track after release. Never mind that they don't actually hold high profile terrorists in those countries.Even more ridiculous is the plot about the Informant in Russia, naturally an entirely innocent man.This is where the obligatory amazon wokeness comes in. Aside from one, the white characters are all either corrupt or killers. The non-white characters are predictably flawless and blameless. And of course the Russians are portrayed as pure evil again.Even more ridiculous is a line about a character dying in Iran because they don't have medicine there due to western sanctions. Who writes this garbage? Iran has better medical care than most middle eastern nations and a life expectancy of 77 which is higher than most East European nations and only 2 years lower than the US. Sanction against Iran don't even include medical products.As mentioned the portrayal of the CIA is ludicrous as well, presenting them like some incompetent squad of hobbyist hitmen who sell out innocent informants at a whim and kill their own agents in elaborate theatrical setups over a phone call instead of bringing them in for questioning.What good is there to say about the film? Some of the acting is good. The color grading is nice to look at for once. And it's not 2 hours, though the slow pace makes it feel longer.
ok I found this worth watching even though it makes no sense -
ok The lives of Henry Pelham and Celia Harrison changed forever with the tragic deaths of 120 people in Flight 127 in Vienna, Austria. Henry and Celia were working in intel at the time, and they failed to prevent the atrocity perpetrated by terrorists."All the Old Knives" juggles two unresolved questions. The first is the quest to understand who was a mole in the office of Henry of Celia. The turncoat was feeding critical information to the terrorists during the standoff. The second issue is the romantic connection between Henry and Celia. What specifically happened to lead Celia to break off ties with Henry, leave the CIA, and move to Carmel-by-the-Sea?Despite the often sluggish flashback sequences, the film was successful in juggling the two narrative strands. The dialogue was intense in the protracted restaurant scene where the two former lovers sought to reconstruct the past.The filmmakers took a chance with a melodramatic ending that didn't quite ring true. For two high-level investigators, Henry and Celia really didn't communicate very well with each other. Still, there was good chemistry between the actors and some crisp dialogue in what can only be described as a romantic, espionage potboiler.
ok Firstly, the soundtrack is SO over the top. There needs to be a no-music version so that intelligent people aren't flooded with stupid melodramatic sounds.Here we have Chris (do I look like Brosnan?) Pine and Thandiwe (I'll show you my tits) Newton, who isn't aging as well.The story might have been fine in capable hands, but this cheapie with poor acting sort of plods along and you can tell by how long there is to go whether there is something else evolving to not care about.It's a straight-to-DVD calibre of movie that would be a time filler on a (very) long flight.
bad So if you want a 90 minute sleep here's your chance.Overuse of flashbacks leads to the very confusing nature of the film. The use of some good British actors is diluted by them speaking faux American. It is very ponderous, with minimal suspense, thrilling moments are non existence. Overall the film is dull and offers no moments of excitement, just a state of confusion.
good Haven't read the book but this movie's one hell of a screenplay. Plot keeps you hooked till the end. Fabulous work by entire cast and excellent direction. A not-to-be-missed subtle yet powerful spy-espionage film.Now about the underlying premise, the politics of war, hatred, revenge, justice... it's leaves you frustrated, helpless. We all know the unfairness but that doesn't lessen the pain.
good I've seen other ratings, so far there're 10 one star ratings, come on, this is much better than that. I saw one review complaining about Chris Pine's face - you should not be allowed to post reviews here, let me tell you that.So here goes, this is not a groundbreaking thriller, but if you've liked Ghostwriter from Ewan Mcgregor, you'll love this. Strong performances by both the main actors and the supporting cast also did their job nicely. This story is not new, but how original can an espionage thriller get? The twist at the end I kind of saw coming but it was surprising the way it went down nonetheless. Soundtrack is nice, visuals you see are nice too, gives you the feels of an old fashion thriller. The chemistry between the main characters is excellent too, keeps the story intact. Movie is not long or too short but perfect, doesn't add unnecessary scenes nor rush through scenes. Amozon released two good movies at the same time, watch this one definitely if you like thrillers, watch The Outfit too, that one is also a good movie.One request though, if you were expecting an action movie or you're a superhero fan (nothing against superhero movies, I like those too) and you do not happen to like this genre, please do not rate this bad cause I want these kind of movies coming up in the future, I don't think i'm the only one. And also when you're reviewing a title, try to stay relevant too. Have a nice day !!!
bad Really, it's not that good. It's a gratuitous affair wrapped in a who done it mystery, with a table turner twist on top for good measure. Has some big time name actors, that's about the only draw this film has, not only CP carrying but basically a CP+TN duo carrying, with contributions from a handful of others. That's about the only draw this film has, otherwise, does not seem like that much interesting, new ground covered.
ok Much too many flashbacks make the film confusing to follow. Otherwise All the Old Knives may have been more appealing to the viewer if telling the story straight forward.
ok I didn't find this to be very engaging. Let me be clear on this; I'm really tired of gratuitous sex scenes. It's not as appealing as directors might think. It's uncomfortable and unnecessary. This movie needed better writing and a little um...I don't know... action. The long monotonous droning soundtrack was tiring.
ok The story is so bad. You just feel like your watching two people at a wine bar yapping on for most of the film. Really tried to be an intelligent spy film and failed miserably. The worst episode of Homeland is better than this.
ok Not sure if it was the writing or the direction but this film was a letdown. Good cast. Cinematography was amazing. All wasted with a weak story and bad ending. An ending that leaves you disappointed and annoyed.
good It's fair to say I haven't always been the biggest fan of Nicholas Cage, but it's not the talent, it's often the film choices, similar to Michael Cain, he really has made some shockers. What this film does however is poke a little fun at his past, it's tongue in cheek, but it's a cracking movie.It's funny, it's energetic, it zips along, there isn't a single dull moment here, you don't need to be a fan or a critic, this movie is just really worth your time.Loaded with irony, it's plain to see that Cage has a sense of humour, this really is a winner for him.It wasn't what I was expected, but I am so glad I went to see it, I'd really recommend it. 9/10.
good First of all, it is great to see Nick Cage working with such actors like Pedro Pascal who can not only keep up with Cage's screen presence but also enhance it. Secondly, as I have stated in the title, you'll enjoy this experience regardless if you are a fan of the man or not but if you are a fan, then you'll be very glad to see that the film has many nods to Cage's evolving filmography throughout the years. In the end, movie is both a cheesy (and well aware of itself) and a special thing that's not like any other comedy movie.
good "Paddington 2" has a perfect 100 score on Rotton Tomatoes and is the most adored film of all time.This film stars Nicolas Cage is the title role which clues you in to look for irony. Cage is down on his luck and agrees to travel to Spain to meet Javi (Pedro Pascal) a major fan who wants Cage to star in a film for which he has written a screen play. The two start a bromance and then the CIA contacts Cage and informs him Javi is a kidnapper.The film is smartly done especially if you are familiar with the various films done by cage. It seems the French, who loved Jerry Lewis also love Cage. It was an unexpected joy.Looks like I have to add Paddington 2 to my watch list.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.
good Greetings again from the darkness. Calling all Nicolas Cage fans! Put the bunny back in the box and get ready for the most fun you'll ever have with Nicolas or Nic or Nick or Nicky. And if one Cage isn't enough for you, you're in luck. This film has Nicolas Cage playing the (somewhat) fictional Nick Cage, and Nicolas Kim Coppola (Nicolas Cage's birth name) playing imaginary alter-ego Nicky, a younger version of Nicolas Cage from the WILD AT HEART era who spends the movie constantly reminding Nick that he's a movie star.If you can't make much sense out of all that, don't worry, writer-director Tom Gormican and co-writer Kevin Etten have created a film that is sure to strike a chord with Nicolas Cage fans. What we see is a parody going meta in a surreal way. Very few get to star in the tribute to their own legend, but that's what happens here. Nicolas Cage goes 'inside baseball' on the career of Nicolas Cage ... only he does so as struggling actor Nick Cage, an actor so desperate for "the role of a lifetime" that he improvs a reading for director David Gordon Green (Cage's director on JOE) in the parking lot of Chateau Marmont.Having been kicked out of his rental after falling behind $600,000 in rent, Nick agrees to take a humiliating job pitched by his agent, Fink (Neil Patrick Harris). For one million dollars, he is to fly to Mallorca and hang out at the birthday party of rich super fan, Javi Gutierrez (a terrific Pedro Pascall, "The Mandalorian"). The twist here is that CIA agents played by Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz suspect Javi of being a notorious gun dealer who has kidnapped the young daughter of the Catalonia President. Spy-type shenanigans ensue as Nick and Javi develop a bromance that finds the two new buddies writing a film script together. And if that's not quite enough subplots, you should know that Nick is at a breaking point in his relationship with his ex-wife Olivia (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter Abby (Lily Sheen, real life daughter of Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale).The zaniness includes nods to more than a dozen Nicolas Cage movies, and much of the fun is derived from recognizing these. Easter eggs are everywhere for fans, and Nic expertly plays Nick (and Nicky) as a loving tribute to the characters we've seen in so many iconic films over the years. Additionally, on screen love is provided for the 1920 classic, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, as well as the more recent gem, PADDINGTON 2 (2017), making this a tribute to cinema lovers, Nicolas Cage fans, and comedies in general. I will admit to disliking director Gormican's 2014 movie, THAT AWKWARD MOMENT, so much that I hoped he was done as a filmmaker. It turns out, he's back (and much improved) ... not that he ever went anywhere.Opens in theaters on April 22, 2022.
ok To give you insight into my relationship with Nicolas Cage, I will quote the end of my review for his movie Jiu Jitsu, which I gave 1 star:"This is just a straight-garbage movie. Damn you Nick Cage!... I wonder what movie of his I'll watch next."I've been a fan of his for so long. I think he's very talented and has a certain crazy appeal that you don't see from other actors. And I keep watching most of his movies even as they plummet in quality and rarely make it to cinemas. He still makes them entertaining, even if they are awful. This is a huge contrast to other former A-list actors who have gone down the same path but with unwatchable movies. Like fellow Face/Off star John Travolta or Bruce Willis (we will miss you!).So when they decide to make a movie that's essentially all about Nick Cage, of course I'm 100% in. And I have to say, this is his best movie in years. It's levels above the quality of his recent direct-to-video movies and is definitely cinema-worthy.I laughed a lot. A couple parts had me crying from laughter. And when I wasn't laughing I was generally amused. It felt so refreshing to laugh with his movie rather than at it. And with the lack of comedy movies lately, this came at a perfect time.Other than the comedy, this is a mostly well-made movie with a story and characters that kept me invested. I love the meta aspect. Nick Cage's performance in this role is perfect. It has a good supporting cast with the standout being Pedro Pascal. He's so likeable and has great chemistry with Nick Cage. Their relationship drives the movie. Pedro Pascal is a star.I had a great time with this movie. I think most will enjoy it, but the ones who will appreciate it the most are the fans who are familiar with his work. (1 viewing, early screening 4/13/2022)My favorite Nick Cage movies:(1) Face/Off(2) Kick-Ass(3) Matchstick Men(4) The Rock(5) Con Air(6) National Treasure(7) The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent(8) Next(9) Knowing(10) Lord of WarI didn't know if I should count Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse since his role is so small, but it would be behind Matchstick Men.
good Nicoles cage at his best ,and he has finally accepted the fact that he is a meme and this movie no exception. It has many nods to his past works and I love what they have down with this the movie, it truly is something beyond words. The comedy is spot on and is the funniest film I've seen in memory and the comedic timing really puts it at the best of all time. This movie deserves the credit it gets and I hope others can see it for the way it is ,rather than a fad of the time. An if this was the ultimate send of for Nicoles cage this is the perfect movie for any actor to make and I wish others would do the same. It really makes you respect the actor more than you did before even if his movies can be cheesey and poorly performed,but this is something else it is a showcase of his strong point as an actor. An I think as an actor nicoles is very misunderstood for his actual good performances, because in the end of the day he is a good actor it's just the reputation he has. So if you are reading this I hope you can understand the points I have brought up and truly enjoy this movie.
ok The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a standard action comedy elevated by meta aspects. Particularly, Nicolas Cage as himself is a great gimmick since he's embraced his meme status. Still, Massive Talent is a missed opportunity because it's otherwise generic. The self-awareness is fun, the self-deprecation works, the Cage/Pascal chemistry is endearing, and the ending is heartfelt. However, the plot is lacking. Massive Talent admits that talky comedy and shoehorned action are lowbrow, yet plays into those tropes. The climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas. Therefore, Massive Talent combines wit with mediocrity, making it a mixed bag.Meanwhile, Massive Talent's technicals are minor. There's fitting music, believable production, and blending sound transitions. The editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines and maintains a tight runtime. However, the cinematography isn't proactive, the effects are sparse (besides a young Nick alter ego), and the direction is basic. The tone takes itself just seriously enough, but the presentation of this material is bland. Ultimately, Nicolas Cage's commitment, Pascal's innocence, and the vulnerable family drama drive Massive Talent, but only so far. It's a fun movie that Cage fans should enjoy, but don't expect much else.Writing: 6/10
good When Nick Cage (Nicholas Cage) realizes his finances are disastrous, he agrees to make a one-time appearance at a billionaire's birthday. Once he gets off the plane and meets billionaire Javi (Pedro Pascal), a friendship is struck up. Before Nick can get too comfortable, he finds out that his new billionaire friend is being watched by the CIA, who quickly recruits him to be their new informant.If this film had been made with and about anyone other than Nicolas Cage, I don't think it would have worked. This film was written to highlight some of Cage's best moments in his career, leaving the viewer with Easter eggs galore. The direction of the film taps into the action genre while still being a true comedy. Just when you think it's just a comedy, it switches gears into a crime drama. The cinematography brings you to the gorgeous paradise of the film's setting.As previously stated, Nicolas Cage is fantastic and shows why he's had such a long career. Buddying up with Pedro Pascal is a match made in heaven. These two play off of each other so well. Tiffany Haddish delivers some memorable lines and commands the scene when she's in it. Ike Barinholtz has impeccable comedic timing as always, and the biggest downfall is not having more of him and Haddish. Sharon Horgan and Lily Mo Sheen round out Cage's family, and the dynamic feels pure. You get a true sense of a dysfunctional family that truly loves each other. And last but not least, is Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Cage's agent with gusto.It is hard to find fault with this film. I'm not sure if it's because it is so much fun or because the runtime just flies by. So elements such as the score and other technical areas don't shine too brightly, but I'm not sure they were intended to. Some characters could have used a bit more screen time, but keeping their appearances to a minimum made their moments a little more memorable. Going up a notch in some of the action set pieces would have been the icing on the cake, but now I'm just getting greedy.The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a film that is going to be talked about for years. The way it is constructed and written leaves it as a prime candidate for multiple viewings. It is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny and earns every one of them. I can't wait to watch this one again and again.
good Caught an advance screening tonight and I thought it was super fun. I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan, and it was over the top and crazy and chaotic and heartwarming. And there's definitely some cuckoo stuff mixed in, I'm actually a little surprised he didn't take the weirdness even further. And he yelled a lot but I would've taken even more. Haha Definitely a light silly night at the movies :) LOVE LIVE CAGE.
ok The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Nicholas Cage movie, about Nicholas Cage and his fight between his artistic aspirations and his chasing of the big bucks as a movie star. In other words there's lots of over acting, lots of action and it's very very clever and funny. A wonderful movie and we'll worth seeing . 8/10.
good Best work of Nicolas Cage. Didn't expected it to be soo good. The Bromance at its best. The Bottom Line Very entertaining, if less exotic than it sounds.
good Watching this film I was unsure if it was a comedy, a farce, or Nick Cage's personal fever dream, but no matter what it was, I loved it! Clever and compelling, this film weaves a tale that results in laughs both hearty and wry. A+
good This movie is a blast of entertainment a perfect spoof of Nicolas playing himself with great references, wackiness, and brilliant surprises! A treat for fans or not a The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a well constructed delightful experience. I love how everything plays out if I could be the equivalent of Pedro Pascals character I definitely would I'm a huge fan of Nicolas's films and this one is a ultimate fun! The action is badass, dialogue is well written and hilarious the bulk of the duration.
good My score: 9.2/10
good Nicholas Cage is back!Not that he went anywhere.You don't have to be Cage fan to like this movie, but it helps.Besides who doesn't love Nick.Especially when his alter ego from "Wild At Heart" is digitally de-aged and gets to ride shotgun as his conscience during this 1hr 45 min action, crime, thriller, laugh out loud comedy Cage Fest.Nick plays himself as a cash-strapped Nicolas Cage even though at his poorest he still had 25 million dollars in the bank, even after his real life expensive divorce.British actor Sharon Horgan plays his on screen wife "Olivia".In "The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent" Nick agrees through his agent "Richard Fink", Neil Patrick Harris, during a funny steam room scene to make a paid one million dollar appearance at a billionaire freaky super fan's birthday party...just so he can pay his massive Hotel bill of $600,000.In the next 1 hour and 47 minutes Nick is enlisted as an informant for the CIA, who suspect the billionaire fan, Pedro Pascal as Olive Garden Mogul "Javi Gutierrez" is a drug kingpin.The real CIA agents are Tiffany Haddish as "Vivian" and Ike Barinholtz as Martin.If Ike looks familiar its because his brother is starring as "Marcus" in #Netflix "Superstore".However Javi is keen for Cage to read his script and get cast in his next movie...this is when all hell and fun breaks loose.Bear in mind I watched this film the night after seeing "Everything Everywhere All At Once", so I leapt from one trippy movie into another where Nicholas Cage is playing himself and even when he's not on screen word on the street is he is permanently in Nick Cage mode.Nicolas Cage joins a long list of actors who played themselves in movies including AL Pacino, Bruce Willis, Keanu Reeves, John Malkovich, Sean Penn, Anna Faris, Charlie Sheen, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bill Murray, Bruce Campbell, Joaquin Phoenix, Ben Affleck, Julia Roberts, James Franco and Arnold Schwarzenegger.Blink and you'll miss it moments: Demi Moore as the movie version of "Olivia" and Director David Gordon Green playing himself.In Pascals own words this movie is "really fu*$ing funny" which is why I'm giving it 9 stars!
good I would watch 10 seasons of this as a tv series. And Pedro Pascal...what a pleasure to watch. A whole world of comedy gold to be mined there. And Nicolas Cage .. a career that has some of the most memorable and comic/tragic scenes ever filmed.Leaving Las Vegas has inspired and haunted me from the first time I saw it. The casino scene where Nic tips the table over screaming about his son....But the Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent honours Nic's persona in such a delightful way... every scene was a treat and the movie ends way too soon.
good Very cheesy, but self aware. It was good to laugh at the movies again. Pedro Pascal and Nick Cage somehow made magic together. An unlikely but very effective duo. Even the action scenes were well done. Awesome cast and stunning location. A hilarious and fun ride.
good Nicolas Cage is a good actor, but it's his over the top energy is what he brings to some of his characters, is what his fans mostly love.Washed up actor Nick Cage unwittingly gets tangled up with a suspected terrorist(Pedro Pascal). Ends up working for the C. I. A. . While also trying to mend a broken relationship with his daughter(Lily Mo Sheen).The movie has a lot of craziness I'd rather not get into. It's a fun ride, you regret taking. Really admire Nicolas Cage having the guts to spoof himself, and he does it with such a funny style. Cage and Pascal have such a funny chemistry to the point it would seem like a comedy team. Everybody else here also gets there chance to shine. If you are in the mood for a big laugh, then give this movie a look.
good This film was so fun & hilarious! Nicholas Cage as a fictional version of himself was awesome. His chemistry with Pedro Pascal was prefect. Massive talent is a must watch for Nicholas Cage fans.
ok Depending on your level of hero worship to Cage, it's either a multi-layered adult drama with iconic self-reflection or a narcissistic ego trip which can't make its mind up what it wants to be. None of it was particularly great, although the acting was good and the premise showed a lot of promise. The action was passable, the comedy minimal and the story inconsistent.
ok At more than one stage appearing destined for a sad demise in the lands of direct to video releases that ranged from the tolerable to the diabolical, the recent career revival and public adoration towards Oscar winner and walking meme Nicolas Cage has been a sight to behold and easily one of feel good stories of modern Hollywood history.It's hard to nail down an exact time and place where Cage reminded us all that he is in fact some form of national treasure but with the likes of recent releases such as Mandy, Joe, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and last years wonderful surprise Pig, Cage has started to deliver products that are not only on par with his early to mid-90's output but arguably career best with new meta-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent taking Cage's new found place in the adoring world to all new levels of goodness.Teaming up with sophomore feature director Tom Gormican to bring his real-life persona into a wild mix of his Hollywood self, Cage is here playing himself in a wild adventure that see's the committed performer a guest at Pedro Pascal's Javi Gutierrez's Spanish villa as the long-time Cage fanboy invites him to his home in an event that quickly turns dangerous as Cage is called upon help the US government stop a group of deadly arms dealers.Narratively there's nothing to get overly excited about here but the glue that holds this romp all together is the fact Gormican brings out the absolute best of Cage that is sure to be a treat to anyone that has watched his career blossom from bit parts in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, to Oscar glory in Leaving Las Vegas then sad appearances in the likes of The Wicker Man or Left Behind, with Cage here having the time of his life reflecting on his up and down career, riffing of his imaginary younger self and creating comedic gold chemistry with his co-star who proves his just as at home in a film such as this as he is in Mexican cartels and battling evil in a galaxy far far away.Rarely stopping for a moments pause, once Cage arrives as Javi's picturesque villa and strikes up a budding friendship with the film loving screenwriting fan, Weight just goes for broke as it throws Cage in a series of over the top and crazy situations with highlights coming thick and fast in the form of cliff jumps and acid trips and while it does start to lose steam once Cage's ex-wife and daughter arrive on the scene around the three quarters mark, there's a lot of good will built up from the film that ensures its never far from providing a fun time for all who signed up for the adventure to Cage's world that we are just living in.A film that for all intents and purposes should never have existed if we were to rewind mere years ago, Weight is a memorable addition to the totally unique and once in a lifetime career of one of Hollywood's most engaging icons, Weight has no right being as entertaining as it is as it gives us an insight into the world of Nic Cage, the man, the myth and the legend.Final Say -Likely to be a new favourite for any of Nic Cage's long-term fans or new bandwagoners, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a hugely entertaining film that doesn't unleash anything spectacular but does a fine job of allowing its leading men to have an absolute blast in a meta-comedy that will be one of 2022's most genuinely surprising outings.3 1/2 Donnie Brasco situations out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
ok I don't see movies in theaters very often, but this looked well worth it. I'm actually glad I went to the theatre for it because had I paid to stream it or waited for Redbox, I may not have finished it (or may have split it over a couple days). I love Cage, but this was just not as good as the current score here on IMDb (7.8 as I write this) says it is. The high ratings must be from people who can't separate the older Nicolas Cage flix from how this movie actually was. Maybe those who want to say he's "back" - not that he went anywhere - want to rate this higher than it deserves to ensure that he returns to the "A" list. It was ok, but lacked something. I liked the alter-ego character of Cage that other reviews say was Sailor from Wild at Heart. Initially I thought it was Randy from Valley Girl. It would have been cool to have a few of his old characters sprinkled in as the alter-egos, but that wasn't the case. Overall it was a bit dull and drawn out.
good The only way I see people not liking this movie is if they openly dislike Nicholas Cage in general. Not only does the dynamic with Pedro Pascal work SO WELL in this movie but I would argue that its some of the best acting either of them have done in their careers.I was worried the humor would get cheesy but man, there were plenty of great laughs. Even funnier if you get all the Nicholas Cage references but the movie doesn't rely on it. That definitely contributes to how the meta movie is at times but they also find other ways to do that.Maybe the most pleasantly surprising aspect was the emotional moments. Despite the movie not being super consequential, you still feel the impact of the deeper scenes and I loved that. I had a feeling this movie would be good and I'm happy to say it exceeded my expectations. 10/10.
ok Time to remind the audience that Nicolas Cage is more than a meme, but an Oscar awarded best actor. Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is the perfection summary of Cage's current stage of career and life.I'm doubtful with the movie's approach in combining self salute, out-of-context comedy, espionage operation, duo development, family reunion, and movie-within-a-movie stuff, which entirely messed up the pacing, and pushed the story to the edge of becoming a farce.However, aside from the plot, Nick Cage is just too charismatic both as an actor and a realistic human being. Comedy is difficult to navigate, but by presenting his overreactive, dramatic self into serious actions, Cage converts the capricious facial and bodily expressions into laughable sequence. Despite the comic words, Cage implies his struggle in the real world: a talented actor who's remembered solely as "king of bad movies", who's drunk in his former glory. Beneath the deep eyes, is a bewildered, yearning, aging man.
ok .. what happens when you put one of Hollywood's last legitimate megastars, a genuine A-lister who can carry a film all by himself if he has to, in a second-rate production with a dismal second-rate script where nothing at all happens for the first 30 minutes ... and when things finally DO happen, you almost wish they didn't. Honestly. If I want a story where shadowy figures behind the scenes sanction bad things to good people, I CAN JUST WATCH THE NEWS.
ok Army Ranger Sgt. James Harper (Chris Pine) is discharged from military without benefits for taking pain medicine while recovering from a knee injury. Desperate to feed his family he works for a private firm. They go to Berlin on a mission and not only discovers he is expendable, but they were counting on it.Sgt. Harper is not as slick or clever as Jason Bourne. Nor can be torture someone like Liam Neeson. The film moves along, but the Hollywood twist is predictable. Dialogue was not memorable.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.
ok This is a decent movie with a decent story and decent action. Chris Pine gives a great performance. Unfortunately this movie is also fairly slow, fully predictable and very regular. It doesn't stand out in any way, but at the same time I didn't mind watching it. (1 viewing, 4/5/2022)
bad Paint by numbers ex-military story, everything you can guess just from the movie poster. After the first 10 minutes it's straight forward, with all the required military jargon to add some authenticity to this.The plot is basic, the plot twist is obvious from the beginning of the mission and the ending is expected.I can't give away any spoilers as they are too easy to guess what happens.Overall, very limited action scenes. Chris Pine is barely ok, he has a limp then he doesn't, then he does again. Ben Foster is his usual character as well as Keifer. Everything is as it should be.Zero surprises and because it's so a-b-c I give it 3 stars, not enough action for the action genre, def not a thriller, mystery or drama. Maybe a Background Movie Genre to watch while you're distracted with your phone or doing house chores.
ok Aside from being nothing we haven't seen already tons of times and much better, even the great leads couldn't save this hollow, dull, slow, convoluted and plot-hole riddled writing and directing. Was this even edited? Who cares about the flashbacks or the daddy issues? None of that was needed, as there was already lots of other filler for the little substance there was, in the dragged out and slowly paced 103 min runtime. The entire story was cliched and predictable. I feel bad for Pine, Foster and Sutherland having this mess on their resumes. It's a 6/10 from me.
ok Chris Pine performs admirably for his part... Unfortunately, the story doesn't have much to say. Nothing about it is memorable. It seems like a script more suited to Stallone, Arnold, or Bruce Willis in their youth. Pine, you are too young for this mediocrity. Leave these kinds of scripts for the older guys. By the way, I hated the Steve Trevor of Wonder Woman 1984. That was worse than this.In conclusion, I am left with the question what was the point of this film? I think younger people might like it for the gun fights.
ok The pacing of the movie is just off. First 20mind or so nothing really happens at all, then some decent random action scenes spaced out but nothing great. Disappointing overall, just a very generic and not well done action movie. Better to just watch tv episode of swat.
bad I accidentally watched The Dog, another film about a disgruntled ex-servicemen struggling with life. This is similar, but in The Contractor instead joins a shadowy outfit undertaking dodgy missions in Germany. It's not believable, on may levels. The acting was good, some decent action, but the story was just forced and unengaged. A rewatch of the first Taken would have been more satisfying.
ok I usually watch horror movies but in the middle i want an action movie Once in a while.. So i chose contractor. It wasn't that bad but action was missing... i mean really action.. car chasing, gunshots, bomb explosions.. kind of Liam Nison movies, or Jerald Battler's. Beside 3-4 quick scenes nothing more happened.. it's like watching a horror movie with no blood at all, no death..
bad Boring, predictable, insufficient action, all poorly done. There is literally not a single moment in the film that I would single out as interesting, this is an attempt at some kind of drama or I don't know what else it would be.
ok The story was interesting, the hand-to-hand fighting was good, and the action was pretty good :-) Chris Pine played the character intensely, while all the other actors were just secondary.
ok If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)"The Contractor is one more generic action flick with a story borrowed directly from the formulaic Hollywood closet, without any surprises or even high entertainment levels.Chris Pine is the mandatory "famous face" chosen to (try to) elevate a plot seen countless times before, and with Ben Foster's friendly shoulder, they actually manage to carry Tarek Saleh's film for a good chunk of the runtime.However, even with a couple of captivating action sequences and occasional eyebrow-raising moments, this movie can't free itself from the imagination-inhibiting shackles.Inevitably, it will end up falling into the hole of oblivion as soon as the viewers leave the theater."Rating: C-
bad Captain Kirk is run off from a special forces unit for having a bad leg without pension or benefits. This is clearly the sort of World where having a bad leg doesn't disqualify one from active service in a special forces unit. He's then recruited into a top secret private security firm run by Jack Bauer after a 2 minute chat. So a World where one can join a top secret security firm without any security of physical tests. Hmm. Smells a bit fishy. Captain Kirk is then sent without further ado to Berlin to join a team tasked with assassination of a scientist thought to be working on a flu virus. Once again a World where a new hire is immediately sent on the most difficult, sensitive and dangerous mission possible. No try out on a few domestic low grade missions first? Nope, straight in at the deep end. Inevitably the mission goes sideways and Captain Kirk is left to rescue his mate, Ginger Beard by carrying him for miles and then giving him an emergency blood transfusion. Because of course that's something he can totally do because he's Captain Kirk. Ginger Beard immediately stops dying and heads off to Berlin leaving Captain Kirk behind because Kirk's leg is playing up. So he doesn't stay with his mate of many years who just saved his life? Nope, he just buggers off and leaves him in a drainage pipe. Who wrote this garbage? A five year old? Where's the remote. Off!
bad Chris Pine and Ben Foster produced great on screen chemistry in Hell or High Water but what they were handed here in The Contractor was a sophomoric screenplay that is not up to par. Tarik Saleh directed this bad miss like it was his first movie.It's a shame that the Pine and Foster duo starred in this DUD. Sutherland brought nothing to the table - his character was a waste of screentime and he clearly mailed it in....zero effort, zero emotion - just like a robot.
ok The sound is so terrible you either have to crank up the volume to hear what they are saying or use subtitles.The acting is good, but the plot is garbage. The mission goes the way of Seal Team 6 meets Barney Fife.The shootouts in Germany of all places are ridiculous and completely unbelievable. Imagine multiple machine gun wielding military professionals with the high ground shooting at one person 30 yards away with nothing to hide behind, and missing their one-person target even after going through multiple magazine clips (ROFLMAO). It was like a scene from the movie "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" where the lead Waynans character is running back and forth saying "Their shooting! Their shooting!"This is a stupid movie. Anyone giving this film high ratings are either paid reviewers or hyper-fans of one of the stars in this film.
bad Almost didn't want to finish it, plot is all over the place, let's get randomly hired, accept money kill random people without questions, while others try to kill you randomly, and everyone knows where you are always, but bad guy had no idea he came to US and was at his house to kill him ... MKAAAYYY.
ok Obviously a Jason Bourne copycat, but that doesnt mean it is a terrible movie.The good: I kinda appreciated the slow start, by which I got to know the CHARACTERS. At the start this movie is basically a character drama. But only after 35 minutes or so, the full blown action is unleashed. So give it some time, you'll be rewarded for your patience, OR simply skip the first 35 minutes.The bad: many will get bored by the slowburning start, but give this story some time to start up.More bad: there are some credibility issues with the story. For example they raid a laboratory and within minutes the German police is present with full gear. NOT likely to happen for real. But perhaps I am nitpicking...To conclude, this is NOT as good as any of the Jason Bourne movies, but in lack of any new Jason Bourne movies this will (barely) do,The story: an American soldier, desperate for money and a family to take care of, hesitatingly agrees to work for a shady private contractor company, becoming a hired gun. Soon he finds out he is being set up and the company that hired him is about to kill him. Will he come out alive?
bad Sound track difficult to pick up at times. Unbelievable shootouts in Germany. Pine has a leg injury that makes him immobile one minute and then sprinting like an Olympian the next. Public carpark rooftop confrontation surrounded by overlooking buildings that attracts no attention. Too 'Hollywood' to be enjoyable or feasible.
ok Not bad would have preferred more story and action esp ending
ok To start with: I am ex something and I have been working as a contractor myself for the last 18 years. Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya ... been there, worked there, as well for private firms as for NGOs and also some GOs.Now to this film: It's a good flick, yet overly dramatized and in a certain way quite inaccurate. It's a caricatural portrayal - and I didn't expect anything else coming from Hollywood - of the private security and military industry as some "shady, dubious, greedy and highly illegal" entity that collaborates with The Government and does stuff they can't officially do. Yes, stuff like that does unfortunately exist, but this doesn't even scratch the 0,1% mark of all the work internationally and if Mark Zuckerberg's social network would fact-check this it would not even get a "mostly false", but proper "fake news" stamp. You can't depict a complete industry by single incidents.But hey, it's Hollywood, it's what they like to pass as a message, because looking at the direction they have taken over the last twenty years, it has become clear they don't seem to be any more interested in producing entertainment and making profit, but rather to function as political and (pseudo)-moral activists no matter the cost. Hence also the obligatory inclusion of the word "mercenary", because THAT'S what it comes all down to for Hollywood .... and they couldn't be any more wrong than that.Chris Pine does a solid performance and the chemistry with Ben Foster is clearly there. The plot is over simplified by people not familiar with the industry and who must have written their story based on hearsay, NYT articles and a good portion of (bad) imagination. The movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be: An action flick? Well, not quite, with too much drama and talking. A drama? Well, not quite either, with too much action. So it sits somewhere in between and is neither a pleaser for fans of one or the other. Still, the production value is there, the cast is there ... unfortunately the film isn't quite. It's absolutely fine for a one-time watch, just don't believe every lie they try to sell as The Truth. But coming from a biased director, who had done in the past a biased documentary about Guantanamo Bay called "Gitmo", the result was unsurprising.
ok Great cast, well produced, but not much of a story. It's Ludlam-style script without anything new, and though it was well thought out, it was a perfectly predictable and pretty forgettable movie with a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been used for something interesting...
good The Contractor starring Chris Pine is a well-made actioner with an easy-to-follow plot, terrific performances and intense action sequences. It might not be the most original or unique film in terms of plot, but it is an engaging watch with plenty of excitement and intrigue. Chris Pine shines in his performance as the protagonist, while other actors such as Ben Foster, Kiefer Sutherland and Gillian Jacobs are also impressive. The action sequences are quite grounded and realistically done, with several moments bound to catch you off-guard. The background music beautifully gels with the proceedings, and the editing is sharp enough to keep the storytelling focused. While not being totally unpredictable, The Contractor serves you with raw action and tension worthy of your time and money, especially if you like action films. Give it a watch!
ok Neglect this action thriller, that shows how life might turn out if youre an u.s. Ranger, a mercinarie or a military security contractor. Its full of b-wibes and has a plot that jumps like a jack flash and humpty dumpty story of low realism at moments, but as you get into the belly of the beast you cant stop viewing till its over.It has a lot of european film style in it, allthough the propagandic message may feel american.loads of shoot outs and an incredible number of missed shots, but its a film with few waiting moments, a film to consider claims the grumpy old man.
ok With a half decent cast and the production team responsible for some great movies I really was expecting more from this! It's kind of like a budget Jason Bourne! Some of the action sequences feel amateurish, there is no character engagement and overall it feels like a cheap TV movie!
good I don't care what the critics say or the other reviews this was breathtaking. And Tessa's speech at the end was beautiful and something we all need to come to realize.The color work on this movie was gorgeous. The play out of their love story was so wonderful. And so genuine.Both leading actors did a phenomenal job!
ok The premise wasn't large enough for the movie. The actors made the love story convincing. There was great beauty in the choice of locations and images. But the lack of depth in the singular point to which the flow of the movie travelled was too superficial to anchor the film, it couldn't rise to greatness. It's too bad, there were such great elements. I wish I could have given this film more than a 7 (okay) out of 10. {Ethereal Romance}
good This movie was beautify done in time for Valentines day. And so far will be my top pick. It made me cry, so I think the chemistry between the two leads was incomparable. I will say some parts were slow but for the most part the story was very engaging. I loved when she walked across the wall. This movie was not a waste of time at all! Also, IF you love a heartbreaking love stories then this is a movie for you.My own personal opinion is if they were SO in love then why didn't she just stay with him? Must not have been too in love with him. What about when she changes her mind and wants to die again? Or she forgets about him and moves on? The end kind of ruined it for me and it would have made for a better movie if they had ended up together at the end. But again I say, personal opinion.
ok You don't need a big budget to be able to make an average or above average movie. For those that use the excuse this movie only suffered because or give it credit for the low budget are delusional lol.Who decided on the cast? It's not a good idea to cast a 28 year old as a high school teen. Kyle Allen doesn't look 17 or 18, not even close. They don't even try to have Kyle act like a teen. What teen no matter where they're from speaks the lines they gave Kyle?Joey King who I thought was a very good actress, seemed to over-act most of her scenes. Her laughing scenes were forced and very noticeably fake. Although it might be a bit easier to cast a 20 something actress as a 17 year old, once again it didn't work.Is there a shortage of talented high school age actors?The location Avalon, New Jersey is original and a great idea. However, they only showed small, very small sections. Avalon is beautiful and they could have took more advantage of the location.I also thought the music in the movie was very
ok There's a whole lotta of "too" involved with this movie: too melodramatic, too much like "Ghost," too many romantic tropes, too too too. All of that said, I'm awarding it one extra star (5->6) for the serious and sincere attempts by star Joey King and the supporting cast (including Celeste O'Connor and Donna Biscoe) to sell all of it to us with a brightly colored bow (or cap) on top.
ok ...love story with after-life suggestions, but insufficient suggestions. The film could, or should, have beeen shorter by at least 15 minutes. Watchable and soon forgettable.
ok This movie is pretty boring. The couple does'nt appear to have any chemistry. Watch them kiss and see if you feel any love there.The movie seemed to drag on forever, most likely because it was boring. I really like Joey King, but she could not save this mess. Her boyfriend's acting seemed very wooden.Not worth watching unless you absolutely can't find anything else to watch.
ok RATED 6/10
ok "The In Between" opens with a David Foster Wallace quote: "every love story is a ghost story." This is what happens to Tessa (Joey King) following a fatal car accident that claims the life of her boyfriend Skylar (Kyle Allen) and leaves her with a broken heart. Her destroyed phone inexplicably turns on and shows a photo sent to her by Skylar, and she feels his presence at the hospital. Another fellow patient tries to tell her about ADC - "after death communication". This is the punch line and the story line. However there are more plot holes in this movie than in a Swiss cheese. This movie also blatantly idealizes Tessa's desire to end her life to be with Skylar. Apart from the strong acting performance of Joey King (Tessa), this movie is a waste of time. There is no clear direction and the supernatural stuff in this movie just does not make any sense at all.
good I don't understand the low rating or the negative reviews. This movie touched on so many elements of true love and loss. The chemistry between the two actors made it great.You don't really get movies like this very often that touch upon love and the afterlife. This was well done in my opinion.There was a semi similar movie, If I Stay (2014) but in my opinion it wasn't anywhere as touching as this.If only there were an in between where we could communicate with our loved one's one last time. Maybe there is. Maybe some of us have experienced it in some way.
good It's amazing how the individual network streamers are streaming their own movies and shows. So much junk out there, and some good things, but mostly things that have to add a lot of nudity and cursing in their shows. None of that was required for this, it was an amazing movie, the plot and script, while not original, was super well done and kept me interested and engaged to see how it would work it out. The acting, well it was impressive how well the cast sold their characters. Amazing, amazing job Paramount+! Well worth my money monthly (if this was the only thing I watched, which it isn't). It is a sad movie, as you can tell from the description of the show, but boy! It was very touching, very well done and totally worth my time to watch it. Highly recommend this movie.
good April 2022 Construed and overblown teenage drama.Felt like a YA book. Nothing against YA fiction, but then you know you get superficial and draaaaamaaaa.The characters are sketchy, too grown up for their age, much too shrink-y and greeting-card dialogues.There was a cute love story somewhere in it, but they chose not to tell it and go for her annoying problems.Basically, had she not been such an angsty (b) he would still be alive, so that's on her. He was definitely the better person.Her photos are generic, all this 'oh but she's a genius' is boring.By the way, you don't need 'super'natural to say goodbye. Nature gave us the gift of imagination.Nice cinematography, okay acting.
good I actually thought this was done quite well. It was well written, some interesting concepts, first love and horrendous tragedy. Not too cheesy, but you felt the emotions with the characters.
ok The idea of an afterlife place called the In Between was interesting but unnecessary to the actual plot of the movie. It was mostly here to make it different to other romance movies.I like Joey King and I thought she wasn't that bad in this movie along with Kyle Allen, who was also not that bad in the movie.The relationship with the main couple was cute and they did have some chemistry with each other. The accident they go through is effective and emotional when you find out how it happens.But all of these small positives of the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's standard.Overall, this is a standard romance movie with a weird element added to make it different from other movies. It just makes it a supernatural movie for no reason.
ok I am looking at the film as a simple story told in a non linear manner and kept the interest of the viewer till the end. King is very sweet and fits the part of Tess to the T. Rest of the cast were just about OK. I feel most critics have given it a lower rating comparing it with normal big budget films, whereas this one is an out and out made for OTT. Hence I have given an additional star than what I'd normally do. Can there be a sequel?
good I felt soo connected to this movie
good Joey King and Kyle Allen have something special together but I felt like it was all in the right beautiful direction but just needed to to let go a little more and let it all flow into further magic.Overall a lovely and unique take on love and loss.
good Don't usually watch love stories, but I'm interested in the afterlife and this is a bit like 'ghost' but not the same. Bit slow in places where it jumps before the accident and after. Good movie though.
good This is the best love story I have seen in a very long time! Totally unpredictable, keeps you on the edge of your seat every singe minute, completely fresh, with top-notch film-making and great chemistry between the lead actors.I have watched this movie three times with a lot of my friends and we all loved it every single one of us. The people commenting on here are either immature teen boyswho would rather be playing video games, or else people without a heart, or adults who dont care to see a movie about teens. If you want to see a movie that is a great story and told with amazing shots and lots of suspense and total feels, this is the movie for you!!
ok Depending on your expectations and preferences you may like this more or less. And while I dig the female lead here (not just optically speaking, but her acting skills that is), neither her nor the male lead can save the day - sorry for the pun.Love stories can be redeeming and the ones that have a supernatural touch to it may even give hope to some people (eternal love and all that stuff). So as I already stated above, it is important how you view things and how willing you are to open up. Do not expect the chemistry of the people in this to match up to anything from any classic romantic movies though. There is a certain spark that I feel is missing here .. but then again, that may only be me (and quite a few others as the rating is showing of course) ...
good I don't understand people that gave this a bad review. This movie is exactly what it's supposed to be: a movie for teenagers. First love, movie love, something that doesn't actually happen in real life. This is what Hollywood was created for, to give people hope that fairytales exist.Movies are not made to be realistic.If you want realistic, watch a documentary, watch the discovery channel. Movies are made for entertainment. You people keep forgetting that!
bad This movie is borderline plagerism of book series that came out in the 90s and later in the 2000s the author wrote 3 more books. Called Kissed by an Angel. Look it up. Read the synopsis and you will see what I mean. And unless the original author was involved in this film ( which doesn't seem like she was) this borderline plagerism. What's really unbelievable is the lengths the author went to find this. There are obvious changes made probably to avoid being sued for plagerism. But there are SO many things stolen directly from the book. The car accident to the way they come together. He teaches her something. To the way the story is told in before and after to the way he contacts her after his death. ... And I don't believe his "personal story" he claims gave him the inspiration. Because this entire plot down to the details is STRAIGHT out of kissed by an angel. And he probably was counting on no one knowing because it not a super well known book or series. Shame on the writer for stealing someone else's work so blatantly and hiding in a tragic personal story, so no one could question it or risk sounding like a terrible person. I have no problem being the one to do that. Creative integrity should be sacred.
bad This is a movie about 100 different ideas and none of those ideas is well shown in this movie. We didnt even get her story and her mom story and why her adopted father mentioned her mother?? And this man stucked inbetween just for a girl he knew a summer and not about his parents that he was talking about them non stop?? Its a non sense low budget movie. And they dont even look like teenagers and tessa she had a very bad laugh its like if someone forced her to laugh .... its a no no.
ok This was not the best tragic love story ever, but it's close to being one. I spent 15 minutes after it just staring into the sky and crying. And i'm not a tragic love stories fan, i actually hate them, kinda like skylar in the story here but this really hurt me.It's not about if it's logical or fantasy to reach to someone in the in between to try to say something you regret not saying.. it's about the trauma she was experiencing whether or not what she saw and felt was real about him reaching out to her.I feel like my words are disconnected but i really felt her loss and desperation to reach him so muchAnd the ending credit with them together and THAT song
good This is not for everyone I find it beautiful, not gonna lie I cried during the whole movie. I don't care what the critics say I am in love with this movie. You should definitely watch it.
ok Low expectations were what I had when the trailer first appeared on my phone screen. I wasn't even interested to watch it 'till the end. I would roll my eyes on the animation style, it's not eye-catching nor it is impressive.But damnnnnnnn! I wasn't expecting it to be good. It's a feature animated film filled with genuine laughter, comical characters and an above the par plot.The caper team consists of Wolf, Tarantula, Piranha, Snake and Shark, all of which play a different archetype from one another. This team of 5 is evil and yet, you might find that their personalities are very likable, charming and even approachable. This is the heart of the film, the element that keeps the audience entertained aside from its narrative.Ocean's 8 meets Zootopia, this is what The Bad Guys is. You may find the first heist somewhat similar to the all-women Ocean's. There's the restrooms, kitchen tray trolleys, red-carpet staircases, hackings (pretty much every heist film), red laser traps, all of which resemble strongly with the mega heist of the Met Gala in the said film. I found TBG better than Zootopia, which I PERSONALLY found it to be overrated. However, those who love Zootopia will also enjoy TBG as it implies similitude to it.Running for over 100 minutes, The Bad Guys never stops with its steady pacing, putting audience in an enjoyable ride from start until the end.Lo and behold, you wouldn't expect how many twists they are in this. It's a plot twist on top of another plot twist. Just when you thought, there you go, they have revealed all the twists, the film comes in with another unexpected twist , showing that you have also been deceived by The Bad Guys. When you look back at it, it's amazing that all the twists don't come as a force, but rather it oozes naturally, making it a perfect fit to the whole story.The animation style is better than what I had visualized in my mind. Looking at the trailer, I thought it was mehh, but the pencil-like motion drawings got better as time went on. It took a bit of time to adjust but eventually, I liked it.On the other side of the cell, I believe that TBG should offer a larger team than mere 5 animals. It would have been so much fun, exciting and the stakes would be even higher!All the animal outlaws are excellent however, I must say, I'm a little disappointed with their back stories, because there is almost none to begin with. They did introduce each member in the beginning, but I wanted to know where all of them came from, how they can coexist and walk the earth with humans, and how the group was formed in the first place. I know, I'm aware this is an animated film but what a solid story they could have to an already excellent plot.Rounding up, The Bad Guys is definitely in my top 5 films of 2022 as we almost end the quarter of the year. Let's see what the future has in store for animated films!Verdict: If there is one thing The Bad Guys taught us, it's to never judge a film by its trailer.
good This one, as another reviewer has already said , has wonderfully written characters (obviously - written and performed). It's not original - I couldn't care less - once again: originality as is, is overrated in my personal book. So despite obvious similarities with Zootopia I still enjoyed it wholeheartedly. Some of the plot twists can be spotted miles ahead - it doesn't matter. Once we got to know and like these lovely characters we just want to see the story through and know how it all ended for them. Only problem is - most of the climax of the movie doesn't really make sense. Or to put it simply, think it out carefully and you'll realize - it couldn't happen the way the movie explains it. I'd give it 10 stars if it was making sense. And then again - it's not as important as it could be in other movies.Must add some words regarding the cast. They're all wonderful but I can't avoid special mention for Sam Rockwell, it's not the first time I see him but I can promise from now on - I'll make it my business to notice him; Marc Maron is also superb as snake; Zazie Beetz is always unforgettable, and she does it again, and the exact same thing can be said of Awkwafina.To some it all up - if you don't have a special agenda against fun movies - you'll love this one.
good The new DreamWorks film seems very ambitious and something that I have never seen from them before, which is crazy, so it's based on the wonderful book series by Aaron Blabey, along with a all star cast and directed by Pierre Perifel who worked on the Bilby short from the studio, most of their recent films have either been fun or mediocre, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World was the last DreamWorks film that was amazing with everything else in between being just not as strong and even forgettable, but with this there's definitely a lot of hype surrounding this film from the way it looks and the wacky sense of humour and I am very excited about this, I did read a few of the book in preparation for this film, so I saw it yesterday at a early preview or "see it first" if you will and..... no joke, this is the best DreamWorks film in years, I'm not kidding, this is exactly what I wanted and this is what I missed about their writing and style, so let's talk about it!The biggest praise I can give to this film is the animation is quite mind blowing (no pun intended), it seems to take inspiration from the likes of Spider-Verse, Mitchells Vs. The Machines, Zootropolis and even Captain Underpants too, it's stylistic, it's bright, fast, with so much great attention to detail, along with superb characters designs since the bad guys look so unique and expressive in all the right ways, it has the zany cartoon effects too, the animation really takes advantage of cell shading, but it also makes the characters stand out as being memorable and funny as well, all the characters are fantastic, I loved all of them my favourites would
good The Animation Style was so good i really love it 2D but it's 3D if im not wrong its called 2.5D, i like The story to not to fast and not complicated and... i like The plot twist it has a twist and a twist again. All the Best about this movie was the Animation Style i like the new Dreamworks Style i think like every production House of animation Try a new Style like Pixar did after "Soul". You should Watch this with your family now on Cinemas.
good Highly entertaining villain/good guys story that is lovable for all ages! The colors are so vibrant throughout and heartwarming character driven great time; I bet the actors involved had a lot of fun. The Bad Guys are great thieves for good or bad reasons with the encouragement of push pops and life long friends. I loved this more than I could've imagined! The soundtrack is amazing and the story flows very well, I'd recommend to anyone.
good I completely agree with the first reviewer: I had low expectation after seeing the trailer, too. But "The Bad Guys" turned out to be a very clever movie, well-made, with a sophisticated script, and fast-moving. Most importantly: It's not taking itself too seriously. I mean: A shark as a master of disguise!?I don't know (yet) the books on which this movie is based. Oviously the story is also inspired by the various Ocean's 8/ 11/ 12/ whatever-movies, but it is definitely an over-the-top-version of these caper movies. These movies always tried to be believable; "the bad guys" tries to be fun. And it succeeded in that!
good Imagine Oceans 11, the car chases from Ronin, Bullet, and Blues Brothers, along with the crazy humor,with great animation, it's all here! I've seen it twice with the previews we had here and it opens fully in the next few days, I will see it a third time. There are some problems, which really, don't soil the film at all, the pace is fast in the action the driving scenes, the dialogue is snappy, and the voice acting is spot on, but best of all, it is very funny and entertaining. The music by Daniel Pemberton, he did, Into the Spiderverse, is rocking from start to finish. Even the end credits have story going into it. It's in my films of the year list and this 2022 has had some gems, already.
good I didn't expect to have as much fun as I did and it was honestly hilarious and the animation style was absolutely gorgeous. Saw an early screening on the 27th of March (yesterday) and I can't stop thinking about it, already booked a second ticket for the opening night on April 1st!Would absolutely recommend if you love animated films!
good I really enjoyed the movie. It's funny, the action scenes are very well done, the characters are charming, the dialogues are excellent and the animation style, in a mix of 2D and 3D, is the icing on the cake to complete an (almost) perfect animation.'Almost' because the plot was pretty average. It's interesting and even brings a nice message, but I think it lacked a little more development, especially in making the movie more unpredictable. Halfway through the movie you already knew who the villain was and how the movie was going to end. They even added multiple 'twists' to make the story more unpredictable, but almost all of them were far-fetched and failed to surprise me.Despite that, this movie was a breath of originality from Dreamworks after a decade of bland animations. I'll give it a solid 9.
good I remember watching the trailer to this movie back in 2021, back then, I said "A DreamWorks movie? That will be mediocre", and I'm glad to say that I was very wrong; The Bad Guys is a fun, fast, and very uniquely animated movie, it's consistent without being boring, this movie is a lesson on how to do animated movies in a time where all of them lack the creativity the 2000s had, this movie never plays it safe, the plot itself is sometimes predictable but there's a lot of twists you weren't expecting, this movie gives twists after twists, some of them are very predictable, others aren't, this is my only complaint about this movie.Now the Holy Grail of this work is definetly its characters, all of them are so memorable, comparing The Bad Guys characters to this year Encanto and Turning Red it really shows that Pixar should invest more on how they are creating their characters; Mr. Wolf, Diane Foxington, Mr. Snake, Mr. Shark, Professor Marmalade, all of this characters with its excellent voice-acting bring so much life to The Bad Guys, they manage to accomplish someting lacking on today's animated-movie industry, not making the characters the most annoying idiots that you wish all of them die in a car fire because they make the movie boring.Overall, the best Dreamworks movie since How to Train Your Dragon.
good This movie was so under hyped but is probably gonna win best animated film of the year. Funny, intense, cool all in 1 movie. Loved the characters to! 10/10.
good The Bad Guys is definitely a step forward for Dreamworks, despite the fact that its script is quite predictable, the characters have a lot of charisma, that together with a more than excellent animation.Its soundtrack is also quite remarkable, a worthy job coming from Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse composer) this makes the chases and action scenes a visual delight.In conclusion, The Bad Guys is a very good movie that hooks you throughout the movie, it is dynamic and frenetic, with a lesson in morality and emotional moments, It is not a masterpiece like other films from the studio, but if it is moderately successful, we could say that it is the new Dreamworks franchise. Hopefully they improve and refine what was done in this movie in a possible sequel or in other studio projects.
good The Bad Guys uses a familiar story to explore familiar themes but that doesn't stop it from being a great animated movie that's really heartwarming, funny and consistently fast paced with a really strong message at its core.Sam Rockwell gives a great lead performance that has plenty of his natural charm on display whilst having ample chemistry with Zazie Beetz who is equally charismatic. The rest of the cast are all suitably energetic with Anthony Ramos being a surprising standout.The animation style is fantastic, something refreshingly different to the norm that's effortlessly stylish and vibrant. The soundtrack and the music by Daniel Pemberton are both really good, adding to the overall sense of enjoyment.
good Fun and stylish animation with a high level of attention to detail. Despite foreseeable twists, Pierre Perifel brought character-driven plot works for all ages. Wolf and the gang made smooth transition to change habits while taught some valuable life-lessons.
good My god animation/film that is JUST good entertainment and not trying to sell you something.Reminds me of "The Sting" and our lead wolf similar to Lupin III (Monkey Punch) . So the plot may not be very original but the characters are fun and well developed.U rating in the UK seems a little light, given some of the themes.Go see.
good We maybe bad, but we're so good at itThis was a surprisingly fun movie. The plot of this movie was goofy and surface-level, but it's fast-paced animation made it so much more enjoyable than it should have been. For 100 minutes, I was constantly amazed at the amount of energy and excitement that this movie maintained. It reminded me of The Mitchells vs the Machines and Into The Spider-verse. Honestly if the story wasn't so predictable this movie would have been phenomenal.All the voice actors were great. Each one of them brought charms, energy, and silliness to this already chaotic movie.Overall, I loved the chaos and goofiness. Definitely worth check out. 7.5-8/10.
ok Please forgive that terrible joke. This is a pretty good family movie with a great cast and fun story. I love the animation style, it's almost like a combination of realistic and cartoonish. Some aspects look hand-drawn while others look like real photos with a cartoon effect. I don't think I've seen anything like it.Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors and he oozes cool in this role. I kept imagining him in the sound booth just having a blast with the performance. The supporting cast all bring something to the table. Awkwafina continues to shine as a voice actor, although with a much smaller role (she killed it in Raya and the Last Dragon).The only reason I didn't like this more is the comedy. It's not bad. It's mostly amusing. But I only laughed out loud a few times. By contrast, Sonic and Sonic 2 are PG family movies that had me cracking up, although it might not be fair to compare when they had GOAT Jim Carrey.I had a decent time with this movie although I don't see myself revisiting it. I think most families and kids will really like it. (1 viewing, 4/22/2022)
good I don't say anything just watch this movie
good The cast was absolutely hilarious and very remarkable. Akwafina and Alex were the best ladies for the movie . The bad guys were very awesome and hilarious for the kids . The animation was so outstanding and the storytelling was excellent. I bet the author who wrote the books said hey universal and dreamworks animation did a fantastic job on this movie for the kids and adults too .I hope they do the bad guys 2 and I hope the next bad guy is a ðŸŠ who robbed the biggest museums in all of Europe and stole the mummy's artifact and mr wolf and snake work together and tarantula and shark and piranha do they're usual work .
good It's a kids film, but it has lots of elements that makes it a good and decent film. As said, expectations were low, but it show us that their is still hope for more animated films like this.
ok So, it looks to me that the Bad Guys was influenced by the anime Lupin the third. Makes perfect sense, so many animated movies and series are. Sam Rockwell's Big Bad Wolf is a total play on this. Although I did notice that Disney's Seeing Red has a similar look so it looks like anime is getting even more intergraded in everything. I'm good with it!The actual story is by the numbers. These animated features love the idea of teaching children to think outside the box and rising above what the world thinks you are, in a movie that's story arch could not have been more obvious if they tried, but that animation was so good that I'm too focus on it to care.It's a good ensemble cast of characters. The Wolf, the Shark, the Tarantula (Played by Awkafina, a fav in this movie, just really cute), the Parana, and the Snake. It was a good crew and it's kind of great how the character and the voices all gel together.But really, I can't stop talking about the animation. Its realty worth it to watch things unfold. Lots of good kinetic energy, the moving pictures never slow down and consistently lively throughout. Flawless.Thumbs up.
good LIKES:The Pace: Kid's movies are always entertaining and this movie has all the engaging pieces I like at the speed that is entertaining. Kids will surely love the hasty pace of the film, dazzling you with all the quick paced adventure and comedy that comes with it. Yet, the pace is not breakneck, capable of still giving plenty of time to storytelling and allowing the older audience members to enjoy the movie as well. It really is a fine-balanced movie on this part and wins points for me.The Voice Acting: These actors give me chills at what they can pull out of their vocal patterns, and The Bad Guys crew is loaded with wonderful performances that fit the bill quite well. Sam Rockwell nails the lead role well, and I feel he did a great job playing the conflicted "hero" who has a lot of soul searching to find. Marc Maron as Snake is stellar, another loaded gun that has his own turmoil to face, but yet holds the sass and vigor of someone who is ingrained in his ways. The two feel very much like the best friends they portray, and I love the ribbing and vigor they have. As for Awkwafina, a bit more of the prop character, the actress normally loaded with comedy craziness, was actually toned down and respectable, still not too out of her comfort zone, but a much more well-rounded performance. Others hit their marks quite well, and if I had more room, I would go into everyone, but the chemistry between them all is fantastic and really a solid pillar to which this group works.The Character Balance: You've got at least five characters to work into a crime/comedy, and that's not counting a few other characters that have their own involvement in the film. And like a good book, this film does it super well with the characters that they promoted. Each of the animals may not have all the equal time, but they stand out in unique ways, bring their gifts to the table, and provide a meaningful contribution to the film. You, and the younger audiences, will find a character that they absolutely enjoy, and you will get your fill of them in almost every way. The use of each group is fantastic for me, and I appreciate how just about every character had that purpose and meaning to their inclusion.The Comedy: While a bit juvenile at times, the movie's humor is very fun and appropriate for the family. A witty phrase by a guinea pig, the fickle nature of human trends, even just a perfect phrasing that is comedic gold. The Bad Guys uses it all well and mixes things up to stay fresh, exciting, and filled with variety, all while baking it in naturally and not trying to force it in your face. That's right, you don't have to worry about a catchphrase being repeated like crazy, well mostly, and for that, DreamWorks wins the victory for me on the comedy, even if it is not the most mature, clever, or downright unique.'
ok A criminal gang composed of the Big Bad Wolf, an Anaconda, a spider, and a shark are captured while trying to steal a gold-and-emerald humanitarian award given to a guinea pig. The guinea pig, however, thinks he can reform them. The story turns out to be much more complicated than that.It's based on a series of books written by Aaron Blabey, and the visuals and society reminded me of ZOOTOPIA. There are several visual and script references to the Ocean's Eleven franchise. The style of animation is interesting, with handsome artwork that suggests dimensionality, and the different parts of the face outlined in swooping black lines. I did find the pacing frantic, everyone moving so fast that it makes the Tasmanian Devil seem depressed. But the good humor carries this one through.
good The Bad Guys is a stylish and sleek turn for DreamWorks Animation. Predictable on the surface but it had a few unexpected twists that shook it up a bit and its message about doing good deeds - though overly familiar - means well and is decently executed. The characters are perfectly cast; Sam Rockwell carries the story with slick charm and a surprise helping of emotional depth. The humor hits more times than not. That said, when it does miss - usually with the occasional juvenile gags that's par for the DreamWorks course - it can fall pretty flat. Whenever that happens, though, the film does manage strong comebacks, be it a moving character-driven moment, a legitimately funny bit, or a dazzling sequence owing to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The Bad Guys is a totally serviceable family film. Tons of fun visual splendor for the younglings and a fast-paced, artful heist-film vibe for older audiences to admire.
good My 11 year old has all the Bad Guys books and we were so excited when we heard of a movie adaptation. Not knowing what to expect we went as a family to watch it. We all enjoyed it and even us oldies were laughing. A great fun movie and even better enjoyed when you have already met the characters on paper. Fast paced with twists and turns and lots of laughs. Fun and easy to watch. So much scope for a sequel.
ok "The Cellar" has some promise, its atmospheric and its visuals are creepily, compelling. That said, it's utterly spoilt by the unrealistic reactions, of the main characters.The idea of self preservation, in the face of escalating and utterly terrifying revelations, that threatens the family, is met with a suicidal degree of calm. The remaining child, for example, is allowed to wander the house from hell, mostly unsupervised. An ancient predatory demon, who has a track record of hellish abductions, including his sister, stalking the hallways.Most sane people would be pushing said child out the door and burning rubber to the nearest motel. One ideally, with a church, equipped with a demon hunting priest, right across the road.But not these idiots. Nope, they are happy to stick around, blithely looking to solve "the mystery", as if its an episode of Nancy Drew or The Famous Five. "Oh bother, the demon ate Timmy!"In summary, the lack of realism undermines any promise The Cellar, might have had. Its watchable but feels, wooden and wholly contrived.
good If you are familiar with the Greek language or I guess hebrew sign language, you may be able to see some red flags ... or whatever you would want to call them. Before you buy a house you should definitely check what happened there ... no one seems to be doing that in movies ... ok I kind of half kid - I mean we wouldn't get any movies done otherwise, right? Rhetorical question and all that.The movie did surprise me however. I did not expect much and the way it started it seemed to fit into the pattern I imagined this to be. But then it does turn out to be something really interesting and good. The story is tight and it concentrates on what is important. There are still the usual tropes and cliches that have to be checked of course. But still if you are not too nitpicky, the movie offers a lot here. Some may even compare certain things and moods to classics like The Beyond.And then the ending that will "reward" the viewer for having stayed on ... hopefully. Because I would understand if some felt it was a bit too much. Not me and a friend I can assure you. Watch at own peril.
ok Family buys an old home at auction knowing nothing about its history...turns out it's basically a gateway to hell! This was so full of cliches and so unoriginal. Studios be like "Horror films make a lot of money people! Think of a plot...ok I know how bout we have a family move into an old house which turns out to be a portal for the devil!" "Nah that's been done before." "Yeah but we will put a washed up actress in it and add a lot of counting and symbols and imagery and all that and it'll be just different enough to make people think we came up with an original idea." "Great let's run with that!"How many more times can studios put out the same movie?! It's gotten so bad! I should know better than to fall for these horrible films. Avoid this! It's a garbled mess of a movie and the acting is so bad it looks more like a parody than a serious film. Shudder is the worst!
ok I found this movie quite entertaining. There is not a lot left in this type of movie that hasn't been done or hasn't been seen before. Especially the old, big and lonely houses that harbor some dark secret. That's why I probably gave it a better rating (6) then it actually deserves. So, although the whole thing was rather generic. I found especially the first half of the movie quite entertaining, the ending though rather confusing.
ok An "evil house" film that is occasionally Lovecraft-adjacent, Cellar's story has good bones but little meat, and I was more than once reminded of Mitchell & Webb's "Lazy Writers."Add to that constant attempts at suspense that fall short because there aren't any stakes. The overbearing score, always letting you know to Be Really Scared Now Okay! Doesn't help. The first two thirds of the film felt like padding, like B-roll repurposed into something usable after the budget ran out.But when we finally get there, it's actually a pretty good ending! And the acting is adequate, and the production values are good. They just should have left half of this on the cutting room floor.Okay for a movie you watch with friends, fully intending to talk over half of it.
ok I am a sucker for a GOOD scary movie. Overall the story was good but then it dragged on. I kept wondered why the parents did not think to keep the one child they had left safe. I would say for a scary movie it was good, not really a jump out BOO! Type movie. Really just a creepy what if kind of story. Acting was good, the girl in the movie was not great. But the rest of the cast was believable. I miss stories with happy endings but if your into creepy slow burns this one was just good. I won't watch it again, but I would recommend if you have nothing better to watch and love shudder movies like I do.
ok This movie had great scenery and wonderful momentum...the acting was top notch and I was into this movie! However...the last part of the movie left me hopeless. I know that literally ALL horror movies rarely have a happy ending...which this one certainly did not. I don't do spoilers, but at one point in this movie...you're going to go "WOW! What a mom!" You're going to be disappointed. People in horror movies buy homes and NEVER do the research into them. It's painfully too late when they start the research into the haunted house they purchased for practically nothing. Duh. The house sold for nothing with ALL the furniture in it. Yeah. Something seriously wrong with that deal. When something is too good to be true...it usually is. And then the house eats your family. The end. Peace.
bad A gazillion close up shots of Cuthbert a little boy with a nice haircut, a rebellious daughter who had five minutes in the entire film and a clueless dad, did nothing for this super meh long and drawn out story. This film was dreary, lackluster and melodramatic. Watch with the volume down, with subtitles on and turn on some music and you will still be able to follow the story. And all of those nonsensical close up shots on Cuthbert's face only proved that she is old.
bad There's a goat at the bottom of the cellar and his name is Wiggly Woo, although he does have other pseudonyms, and they generally rhyme with pooh, which is quite inappropriate as he doesn't bear any resemblance to Winnie but can whinny when encouraged. Anyway, if you look up the definition of futile in a dictionary: incapable of producing any useful result; pointless - a bit like my opening ramble, but not as much fun.
ok When her daughter disappears in the cellar of the family's new home, a mother suspects the arcane symbols left by the previous owner are the key to finding her again.Ambitious horror that feints toward sci-fi through quantum physics but ends up in metaphysics. The quantum idea is brought in through the touching use of SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat as a metaphor for the plight of mother and daughter, but it doesn't really inform the story. Instead, we're presented with mathematical language as a means of imposing order on chaos, but which opens the door to an evil from another world. The evil has to be confronted on its own terms, which takes us into the other world, where we find the opposite proposition: mathematics shows the way to an eternal reality - the ideal form of what we only perceive in our world as shadows, but a horrible ideal.It's Plato according to Lucifer. There is some internet-research guff about alchemy and the Knights Templar, when direct reference to Pythagorean mysticism would have been more interesting, but the guiding motto Dissolve and Coagulate is an application of the theory of forms, in which a thing is mirrored back from the other world in its real essence - in this story, the essence of evil.That's how I read it, and the intrigue grows as the plot unfolds, but getting there is a mixed experience. One mark of a good horror is how we're taken through the looking glass, from safety to mortal danger, and here the trick is pulled off with chilling simplicity during a phone call - excellent bit of sound design. The climax heaves into view with twenty five minutes to go, but its energy builds with style into a grand vista of eternity in hell. Whew!On the downside, much of the screenplay is cliche, from the sullen teen, to ye-olde-house (ludicrously over-sized), to the marketing babble of the irrelevant boardroom scenes. Underlying all is the fact this story is a retread of Poltergeist, so confining itself to a variation rather than presenting something fresh. Also a few threads that should have been snipped off: the reference to anarchism, which seems to become conflated with the nihilistic ankle tattoo, and the gratuitous Hitler quote right before the explanation of the Hebrew letters. (I hope it's gratuitous, because it does chime with Plato's view of democracy.) They made the same mistake in The Exorcist. And is direct police involvement really needed? Entia non sunt multiplicanda.The biggest problem is with the orchestral music effects, which overwhelm the experience. Perfectly good for the grand climax, and I'm complaining not about the manipulation but about being made conscious of it. So for the first twenty minutes it's all squealing violins and throbbing violas, even playing over the spooky old voice recording - why ruin one sound effect with another? I recently came across the same problem in The Golem, and it grinds my teeth.The performances are OK, but I felt the lead didn't convey enough terror in her search for the daughter - too composed. Nothing remarkable about the camera work, although the depiction of the other world is impressive. Surprised that mirror imagery wasn't used to support the central idea.Overall: Valiant failure to overcome early problems.
bad This is a terrible film. Perhaps the worst film I have seen in 2022. The writer didn't put an effort into writing a cohesive film. The family in the film could have avoided most of their problems if they used a door stop to keep the cellar door open since it tends to close every single time someone walks into that room. (facepalm).How can a busy professional know precisely how many steps from the first floor to the cellar floor. How can this mother waste time with her daughter counting the steps when there is an important meeting she needs to be in as the call is taking place. Why on earth would a mother send her daughter down the stairs into a creepy dark cellar without lights with only a candle to light her way? Didn't she think her daughter might fall down the stairs?Wow, this is pretty darn bad.
ok Love creepy house movies, could have been super spooky. It was let down by the parents "what were they thinking" or not in this case. Who leaves their children in a huge old house the day after they move in, to pitch an idea at work???? The acting by the "mother" Elisha Cuthbert was great. The father was sleepwalking through the whole movie, literally no point having him. Good concept, unfortunately, lack of budget and character development let it down.
bad How can one not recognize the Hebrew alphabet? How can one run some "whatever" digital company who holds preputial meetings on trying to crack the code on "social influencers" but yet hires some intern to figure out "what strange language this is?" (Hebrew)How did the clueless intern manage to use her Googles so quickly and like Daphne and Velma master the language and rearrange the letters to solve the mystery in like 6 minutes.Plus, I hate how people move into a house and they are unpacked by the end of a fully cooked dinner. (Who doesn't take time off from work during a move? Oh, not this family. They went right back to their "meetings" an hour or two after moving in,)I swear the writers used a search engine like Yahoo or Web Crawler circa 2003 and searched "Spooky, Occult, superstition" and then threw it all together like a pot of Gumbo.If I was whatever entity haunting that house I would be really annoyed at how dense this family is and try to send'em packing like the Lutz family.This film was annoying.
ok This movie reminds me of cheap 80's horror movies with its Theme, use of camera and sound engineering, use of music. Probably cheap horror movie lovers like me enjoyed this movie a lot. I hope Shutter continues to make movies like this.
bad The say you can tell if a movie is going to be any good in the first 15 minutes. Well it only took me 5 to realize this was going to be terrible. Slow, dismal and boring is the perfect way to describe this film. 3 stars.
ok A family moves into an old house with Hebrew letters carved above particular doors. The letters Lamed (L), Vav (V), Yod (Y), Tet (T), Nun (N) spells Leviathan, which is the demon that is spoken about being the beast. When the daughter disappears the mommy starts connecting the dots and begin to realize that she needs help in order to save her family from an ancient demonic entity that uses the house as a gateway.This occult themed movie got satanic and alchemical elements throughout and comes across more like a thriller than a horror. If you are expecting gore you will be disappointed. It builds up tension till the last horror-part concludes.If you are into horror and the occult in general you will probably like this one.
ok Family moves into an old rural home and all hell breaks loose.There is nothing here that you have not seen before. Old house with a Cellar, Lovecraft-esque demons and some silly decisions. At least the tension starts to build immediately and it keeps it going throughout the movie.This could easily have been an 8/10 but the character development of the father is non-existent. He could just as well not have been in the story and average acting by the children detracts from the believability. The "research" of the history of the house is also brushed over - that is usually the part of a great horror that makes the viewer sit up and watch and turns the tension up a a notch or two.Elisha Cuthbert still has the best chin in the business.
ok Professional or arm chair (IMDB users)!Granted there is nothing new in this tale ripped from the works of H. P. Lovecraft (ancient Gods) and advanced math (symbols for numbers in a formula structure).That in itself is new tho, as I have read a lot of Lovecraft (sing that to Led Zep "Whole lotta Love - Craft.... Whole lotta Love - Craft..."), and he never, in my readings, equated mathematics with opening a gateway that ancient Gods can come walking in through!Well acted and atmospheric.
ok The Cellar (2022) is a full-feature adaptation of an older short film. The latter is available on YouTube, it's simple and moderately effective.It feels like an ambitious undertaking to bring such a short and simple story to a full-feature length. I can't say they have succeeded.There are two significant problems with this film:1) The time in the beginning that should've been used for character introductions just wasn't there. They rush straight to a scary cellar.2) Since there was no build-up, the middle part got too long and featured the same scenes repeatedly with no progression.I did enjoy the ending, though. It just goes completely off the rails. I still have no idea what the point was with all those numbers and counting. It looks like it was just color, never really adding up (pun intended) to anything.This is the first time I have seen Elisha Cuthbert act in a long time, and now she plays hide&seek with Baphomet, shuts doors on it, and hits it with a flashlight. This is surreal.Overall: nice (although basic) atmosphere, empty, senseless mystery, only one real character.Film's achievements: parents of the year, Baphomet hide and seek.
ok I always approach these channel commissioned Movies with some apprehension. In my book, Shudder has a 50/50 strike rate. However on this occasion I was pleasantly surprised. It is not one for those who seek action in every frame and gallons of blood. But this really intrigued me. And I found myself caring about the characters. And really wanting to know what happened. Although the ending was not a shocker, it still left me wondering. For those who are into the supernatural rather than the supergraffic.
ok The Cellar: A family move into an isolated Irish Manor house, as could be expected the teen daughter Ellie (Abby Fitz) isn't enamoured with the change. Things take a turn for the strange when Ellie disappears in the basement while on the phone to her mother Keira (Elisha Cuthbert). The cellar itself and the steps down to it exude a sinister creepiness . We are off on a journey through possession, the opening of gates between dimensions and the discoveries of 12th century alchemists. But the Demon and poltergeist effects in this case are connected to medieval mathematical formulae. In the name of Schrodinger I compel thee! Begone! Some good shock scenes but most of the horror here is psychological. A bit uneven, at it's worst when dealing with Keira's viral marketing campaigns but returns to the promise of the opening with a cataclysmic finale. Written and Directed by Brendan Muldowney. 7/10.
ok I was wondering if that phrase had any meaning, "leave it with me", no. It didn't have any meaning. The writer/producer, person in charge uses that phrase and instead of having different characters use different phrases, they all used the one that he uses in life...
bad I knew it would be low budget film but dude.. this movie must costs 100 Euros.. you supposed to deal with abyss and some kind of demon.. not even a door broke...the demon's custom was so fake and childish.I knew it would be slow-burning but in that kind of movies you need a strong moment of action and horror as an ending scene...as a reward to the viewer for keep waiting.. this gave nothing.The plot was trying to be different but it finally didn't make it.. silly decisions, lights on-lights off and opening doors. Same stuff again
bad I have watched countless bad films in this genre. So I am not surprised or disappointed with this one. The script is boring and even absurd at times. Acting by Elisha Cuthbert is the sole reson of two stars, the rest of the acting is annoyingly bad. Characterization or character development is non-existent.I will not comment on the high rating reviews. If you are not familiar with such reviews by now, you do deserve to watch this one.Watch only if you have nothing better to do, or have a hobby of wasting your life watching crap movies.
ok The Cellar is a rather good chiller with some really tense moments. The scene of the daughter counting to ten just like in the short, The Ten Steps, works just as well here. Elisha Cuthbert is good in the lead role and makes me wish she was in more movies these last 10 years. The movie, like most of these types of horrors, suffers once the monster is revealed but there is enough here to recommend and leads to a decent twist kinda ending.
ok This movie wasn't very good, I really had high hopes and am familiar with mt. Washington having climbed it many years ago but in the summer. Naomi Watts was not very believable in the lead role. Maybe the story itself isn't that compelling, yeah she saved a guy from the mountain who seemed to be trying to commit suicide. Pam was apparently a rescue person who worked on the mountain but was off duty the day of this rescue. The rescue consisted of a lot of panting , groaning, and falling down . You would never know she was a professional climber watching the way she was portrayed. I think this would make a good documentary, but not enough there for a drama with Watts as the lead, I don't recommended.
bad Major holes in emotional and action plot. Great story, poorly told.SPOILERSBlack toes indicate frostbitten toes, yet "John" recovers and runs away. Duh.Somehow, Pam learns about "John" and meets up with him, but still doesn't know his name?Duh.Two people in freezing cold blizzard both get soaking wet in a creek that would have been close to freezing and just keep on walking down the mountain?Duh.This looks and feels like over dramatization by script writers who have never been outside or on a mountain or in heavy snow and have not learned how to "show" rather than "tell."While the script claims the rescue of John enables Pam's recovery from loss of her children, we don't see that happen; no indication of this critical development that should be the turning point for the central character.Nice try.
bad This is not my type of film. Contains "spoilers." Pam (Naomi Watts) climbs Mt. Washington for therapy. A storm is coming. She discovers John (Billy Howle) sitting half frozen to death. She helps him down. Turns out, like her, her was grieving the loss of a loved one. They both go on with their lives like normal people.Yup. That's it. Should have never been a film. Boring.Guide; Brief nudity (Naomi Watts)
bad Sorry, but I expected a lot more. Based on a real story, so it says. The acting might have been good, but the script certainly not. The dialogue was utterly boring and unrealistic in light of what was going on. Pam must have asked a 100 times if he (John) was okay after he went though the most horrendous ordeals. A pity as it could and should have been a lot better.
bad I spent the whole time watching the movie wondering when it would end, the acting was bad and stiff, the fake snow was really unbelievable and the pacing was confusing.
bad Although it is based on a true story, the movie makes it look really ridiculous, boring and makes the character looks like whinny little girl who never hiked before.As someone who hikes in the mountains a lot during different seasons, I think, the movie made it look like she went "walking" for a few hours in the mountain then she started to struggle and ran out of water, etc as if she was there for days or weeks.The movie should have showed the audience why this situation is particularly dangerous and how someone can get easily lost in a well known area when a storm hits. Those who do not know these facts and not into hiking will be confused how a trained hiker is struggling the way she is!The movie wants us to sympathize without showing us how dramatic the situation is. Most shots are close one and we do not get to see how horrible the situation is and we do not get to fear for our characters safety. I do not know if this was actually filmed outdoors, but everything screams "this was filmed in a very narrow place"!Bad dialogue and zero acting from the dude playing the stranded man. My best guess is some actors just need to make ends meet and therefore, accept such badly written badly executed projects.
bad This story appears to be loosely based on Ty Gagne's Footprints in the Snow. Which by all accounts is an interesting story of a person who follows footprints in the snow and ens up rescuing a suicidal man.But, Infinite Storm feels like the person who wrote it read Ty Gagne then decided to change it up to be random and somewhat pointless rather than stick to what made Ty's story so engaging.Naomi Watts in the movie happens to be part of search and rescue who happens to just be on a walk-about who happens to encounter a big storm and happens to come across a man. This man acts like he's on meth or strong acid, not suicidal. Actually, he bounces between cracking out and being lucid. While Naomi Watts falls all over the place calling his made up name and trying to get him down the mountain.It's not that the movie is bad or good just poorly written, hurried and meaningless. Naomi Watts is awesome as usual. Billy Howle is good as well but seems lost in what his character is supposed to be. Cinematography is good.The problem with Infinite Storm is the writing and some directing. It feels rushed and missing a lot of content. Almost like they hit the end of a budget and wrapped it up. I find it crazy that a movie based on a story that had so much meaning ending up being extremely meaningless. Hard pass on this one.
bad Believe the bad reviews.Starts Off Bad, But Wait, it Gets Worse...
ok Granted, I hadn't even heard about the 2022 drama thriller "Infinite Storm" from writer Joshua Rollins prior to sitting down to watch it. However, with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen and it having a fairly interesting enough synopsis, of course I opted to watch what director Malgorzata Szumowska had to offer.I will say that the movie started out quite alright and was interesting enough for the majority of the playing time. However, while the story upon which the movie is based definitely is impressive and outstanding, then this 2022 movie just didn't cut it. Sure, it was watchable, but that was about it, because it was ultimately a fairly bland movie.The storyline started out okay and had some interesting things along the way, however, I have to say that I never felt that neither Pam (played by Naomi Watts) or John (played by Billy Howle) were ever truly in any real danger, and the entire rescue trek down the mountain just felt rushed and superficial.The acting performances in the movie were adequate, but I never was left with a wow sensation from the acting performances on the screen. Don't get me wrong here, because the actresses and actors performed adequately enough, but I just wasn't bedazzled or impressed by what I saw.Visually then "Infinite Storm" was good, but visual effects and such just didn't really have much of any real important impact on the movie. Sure, it added the element of the blizzard and the fury of nature, but that was about it.For me, then Malgorzata Szumowska's 2022 movie "Infinite Storm" came and went without much of a lasting impression. And once the blizzard settles and the snow is on the ground, this was essentially just a somewhat bland movie experience.My rating of "Infinite Storm" lands on a four out of ten stars.
ok After watching the trailer I decided to give it a shot. I'm a sucker for survival films. For the first 30 minutes it had my full attention. But after John jumps off the cliff and breaks his ankle everything goes down hill. For the rest of the film they were just kinda stumbling around. Don't get me wrong the story is pretty amazing. But the movie itself was mediocre and lacked any real intensity.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Naomi Watts is a gifted actress and always elevates her films, but can someone please cast her in a comedy? The lady deserves a chance to lighten up a bit. Known for her dramatic turns, this may be her most physically demanding role yet. The film is based on a true story and the life of Pam Bales. Director Malgorzata Szumowska and co-writer Joshua Rollins, with input from Ms. Bales, recreate the remarkable events of 2010 on Mount Washington in The White Mountains of New Hampshire.We first see Pam Bales (Watts) as her alarm goes off early, and she goes about preparing for a six-hour trek up the mountain. This includes layering her backpack and her clothes for the below freezing temperatures. She stops by the cafÃ© where her friend (Denis O'Hare) pours her some hot cocoa and tries to talk her out of the climb due to the possibility of lousy weather (which is saying something for this area). However it's clear this date is important to her when she says the climb is "cheaper than therapy", because "mountains always listen and don't talk back." Pam has a special connection to the mountain and to nature.As she begins her journey, Pam sees a couple of campers finishing up their stay. One of them is Eliot Sumner (offspring of musician Sting), who also wrote and performed a song for the film. The other is played by the film's writer, Joshua Rollins. Pam also notices another car in the parking lot, which, although she doesn't know it at the time, does set the stage for her day. Often covered in goggles and snow gear, the hike offers Pam the serenity for reflection, as well as some mind-clearing physical exertion. One misstep sends us the flashback of why this day and climb is so important to Pam; but it's a trail of sneaker tracks in the snow that change the day every bit as much as the approaching storm that caused her to cut the hike short.Those sneaker tracks are a recognizable sign of trouble to an experienced climber, nurse, and Search and Rescue Team member. Pam follows them to a near-death man suffering from hypothermia. Since he is initially non-responsive, she calls him "John" (Billy Howle, ON CHESIL BEACH, 2017) and proceeds to coax, drag, and all but carry him as they begin the slow battle down against the mountain and the weather elements. As he regains some semblance of awareness, John makes it clear he doesn't want to be rescued and was trying to end his life on the mountain. Pam ignores this and sternly informs him that she will not leave him behind.Cinematographer Michal Englert does a terrific job of capturing both the beauty and danger, although there is one close-up of Pam's whistle that seems a bit out of place (minor quibble). Filmed in Slovenia (as a stand-in for New Hampshire), the weather and the view are co-stars with Ms. Watts, and the blizzard is blinding and treacherous, making Pam's actions even more incredible. The film can be taken as the story of one woman's determination, but it can also show how grief is powerful ... and so is a helping hand. One person can certainly have a dramatic impact on the life of another and the way this real-life ordeal played out is quite interesting. Ty Gagne's was the first to publish Pam's story in his article, "Footprints in the Snow lead to an Emotional Rescue" in New Hampshire Union Leader. As always, the film earns bonus points for including "Katie Belle Blue" by Townes Van Zandt ... and we can relate to Pam's difficulty in singing along. The likelihood of Naomi Watts taking on a comedy seems remote, as she's already slated for a remake of the 2014 Australian horror movie, GOODNIGHT MOMMY.
bad All you need to know about this is that snow is fake!!! She was probably sweating in that winter clothing in balmy temperature with fake snow thrown thru industrial-sized fans.Nothing else makes sense. She is search and rescue who is walking out for no good reason??? And so on. Don't bother!
bad In action-drama "Infinite Storm" troubled, middle-aged, loner mountain-rescue woman Naomi Watts hikes her regular trails up New Hamshire's beautiful Mt Washington, but when a forecast storm hits near the top she finds Billy Howle stranded, out of it, wearing sneakers & apparent 'beach' wear - so she sets about bringing him down. From one repetitive 'accident' to the next the clock drags as audience & characters alike feel the visceral pain of them never seeming to progress... and btw once down the miserably downbeat tone still doesn't let up. Writer Joshua Rollins & director Malgorzata Szumowska missed the mark in this 'uplifting' true-tale as it's an infinite dirge.
bad I was trained by a state search & rescue squad, in both rescue and wilderness survival. The abysmal inaccuracies of this movie, for mere "dramatic" effect, are an apalling insult to all rescue workers.A rescue worker knows the symptoms of severe hypothermia. This movie pretends that trained rescue squad worker Pam Bales did not, when her screen character asks questions about substance abuse. It pretends that she suffered life threating missteps, contrary to her actual skills.The movie ignores the very serious issues which had lead the "victim" hiker to his predicament."Based on a true story" -- is about as accurate as saying that because AndrÃ© Gregory and Wallace Shawn have each eaten dinner, then "My Dinner With Andre" was "based" on a "true story."
ok You lost me at the confetti in her mouth that was supposed to be snow. Come on...even very cold snow melts in the mouth. Shame on the props folks.And, Ok, I can wait until the end of a movie for the big reveal, but then it had better be worth it emotionally.
bad Very bad I was looking at the clock every 2 minutes.Was waiting to get better with some action but it never happen.Waste 90 minutes of my life.Very disappointed of Naomi Watts.
ok This could be a really good documentary type of film. However, the contents need to be more. The whole film was so slow, seems like not enough story to tell?
bad What a waste of time and money. Slow and boring throughout. The acting was the only thing that gives it 1 star ðŸŒŸ instead of 0. Stay home or choose another movie.
bad Just don't watch this movie. Boring, unrealistic and just utterly crap. I would advise to save yourself the time and effort and watch a proper movie. There is no good build up, Naomi Watts' acting is fine, but John?Ahw well, just ignore this movie.
ok For those of us returning to cinemas post-pandemic, this was a visual joy: wide-screen snowy mountains, a looming and belting storm, an engaging out-doors woman. Be prepared to suspend disbelief, as this search-and-rescue person shows poor judgement and sets off seemingly ill-equipped into a storm, technically un-proficient in doing a self-rescue from a snow well.Rather over-done rescue sequence of seemingly suicidal man who at times didn't seem worth saving.Also a notable gaffe as the action was supposed to take place in November, but the times projected on the screen show sunup at 6AM and still light in the sky at 7:30PM, too long a day for that time of year.Some pardonable melodrama, but still oddly satisfying in the end.
bad Stay away from the fake reviews.This is doomed from scene 1.Which person in a proper state of mind will go out hiking when the weather is bad and continues when it gets worse? It's our dumb female lead, walking and screaming hello and whistling.Ok, it's a movie. So what. Spare us this trash.Just skip this one and watch a cartoon instead.
ok I agree with GrassRootsGuy. There were somethings that did not feel right from the start. One scene its sunny, the next its a blizzard, then the wind is howling yet the trees in the background are not moving. She's supposedly an experienced climber yet was going up paths that are clearly not suitable for hiking and not exotic or interesting either, just risky to climb, which was plainly stupid - no one would walk up in real life its just an actor getting direction to go up some loose rocks that clearly shows they have no knowledge of mountains.The mountain top should have been a wild, hard to get place but it is clearly a beauty spot that anyone with mild fitness can reach, if there was no fake wind.It felt like some armature cinematographers, producers, directors doing their first movie.This was very off putting, I could not finish but wanted to know what's the story about so I read the plot! Then the reviews all said the same thing so I was glad for not wasting the renaming hour on this.Good effort, try again.
ok The universe is an infinite storm of beauty and sadness.Based on a true story, we have a survival drama about a climber who tried to save a man and herself from a blizzard.As part of the genre where the main character overcomes trauma through others, even though Infinite Storm is not deeply profound like Drive My Car, it was still had its impact.The first 2/3rd was just the rescue part. The pacing was very slow, but there's compensation from the beautiful shots of the snowy mountains. However, Naomi Watts's solid performance was the main factor that invested me in the whole rescue mission.After that, the story transitioned into the personal overcoming that it actually set out to be. The background of the characters were depressing, and I liked how the characters connected with each other. However, this transition felt abrupt, as it should have been more gradual like how Drive My Car did. The pacing here also picked up, but it was too quick. The structural and pacing problems reduced the strong impact that this movie could have achieve.Overall, I liked the message and the performance, but the story's structure hindered the movie. 7-7.5/10.
ok When are these movie producers going to start making movies at the true locations? This is a true story that happened on Mount Washington, yet the mountains look like the Rockies. Does ANYONE in Hollywood know ANYTHING at all about the geography of the world? Mount Washington, even though it is one of the harshest environments in the world, is only 6288 ft. High. I have been to the top of Mt. Washington and it is known as the rock pile for a reason. It is not a jagged peak!!! As soon as one of these movies has such a glaring error, it is REALLY hard to believe anything after that.
bad If you have any experience climbing or backpacking, this movie is not for you. It is obvious they have no knowledgeable actors or advisors on this film about a supposedly experienced climber. The star character makes numerous very basic mistakes in the first 20 minutes of this film and it gets worse after the actual storm starts. The terrain is not very difficult but it is treated like K2 or Everest and watching the carelessness they exhibit to stretch out the life-threatening situation for the duration of the film is painful.I only gave it a three since the acting and filming is not bad. Other than that, this is a hard pass.
good ."I am calling it right now Wahlberg is getting an Oscar nomination for his role as Father Stu ." For six years, Wahlberg had been so driven to tell the story of Father Stu that he self-financed the movie. He said he spent "millions and millions of dollars" to get it made.Wahlberg gained 30 pounds for his new movie "Father Stu."
good Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson star in this unbelievable true story that will have you sobbing in tears when the lights turn on. From the opening scene to the end of the credits it's like your in the room watching them film this.Father Stu is not your ordinary faith base movie it is rated R for language throughout and to be honest this movie probably needed it. This in my opinion was probably one of Mark's better movies in years and same with Mel one of his best in years. They are great actors on their own, but every movie that they do together is a masterpiece.Like I said this is rated R so don't go in to this thinking it's a family film and I guess it is in the fact that it's a faith film, but just with tons of language. I highly recommend seeing Father Stu.
good Truth is stranger than fiction. I enjoyed the film but wish there had been subtitles. Sometimes some of the characters mumbled so much that even though there were extreme close ups with no distractions, many times I was unable to understand what was being said. I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my ability to follow the movie until afterward when I went in the restroom, I heard everyone in there saying the same thing. Probably some of the problem might have had to do with unfamiliar slang but most of it was the way the words were enunciated. Don't let that stop you from seeing it though. It is still worth seeing.
good It is based on a true story over in a boxer forced to retire over in his injuries and brain damage and he wants to seek fame and fortune and is so arrogant about it.But he is likable and he hides that act over due to his alcoholic estranged father and worried mother. He also tries to win a young lady who teaches at a Catholic Sunday School as the long term atheist takes it lightly. He gets in trouble with the law and has fights.Only until a near fatal motorcycle accident makes him put his priorities straight and needs to stop living in the fast lane before it kills him as he is a cat with nine lives wasting eight of them.He wants to be a priest and that others laugh at him and that other supporting student priests do not take him seriously, He breaks his girlfriend's heart as she was expecting marriage.But as he develops ALS aka Lou Gehrig's Disease. He may not have that chance due to developing that and a lot has to do with his lifestyle. And he also tries to reconcile with his alcoholic estranged father as someone says a chip off the old block.Mark Wahlberg is great in the lead role and is growing more and more as an actor. Mel Gibson that Hollywood has seen to really forgiven as he is gruff but has low self esteem as the man's estranged father and Jacki Weaver does a great job as his worried mom, his only supporter and even friend.Based on a true story.
ok This movie is funnier than the ads will have you believe.The story is of a amateur (to put it kindly) boxer who is scrappy in life. He's told often that he can't do something or that life gives him hardship and his stubborn streak kicks in. To a lot of people, his persistence is read as silly and frustrating. To a lot of people he should be beaten to death in an alley somewhere in some small rural town he hails from. Until a fateful night which puts a lot of his life in perspective. Unfortunately, I don't feel that moment is enough to generate the turn of the cheek. But, writer/director Rosalind Ross was smart enough to show how little Stuart actually changes. He instead uses his blue-collar nastiness for good rather than evil. Funny to me, to say the least. I wish they would've played more in that world. Where people expect him to be pious and uptight but ends up being a thug in a collar. There may have been extra chuckles to be mined there, ala Harrison Ford getting ice cream on his face in "Witness."Well, the structure itself isn't anything new. And if you've seen a redemption story, you know what follows. But Mark Wahlberg does an exceptional job getting into the attitude of Stu. In a wild universe, he is Dirk Diggler grown up and trying to find salvation. Mirroring him is Mel Gibson, who plays his father who has his own moment of goodness. It's not much, but it is enough.Yes, there are a few moments that get heavy handed. That's not to say, these things didn't occur in real life. Stu is brash, and edgy and punch-drunk dumb. He goes with the theory that he doesn't know until someone tells him it's wrong, then he doubles down. His logic is that if Christ wanted him alive, it must be that he wants him to double down for him.I've no doubt that director Ross, whom is in a relationship with Mel Gibson, tapped the lighter side of the situation. In different hands, this plays as a broad parody. This was reigned in enough for it to hit where it needs to. Speaking of which...Jackie Weaver is such a blessing to watch. She embraces dialogue that would fall flat coming out of most actors' mouths and hits the right beats. Completely nails the humor beats without knowing she is funny. She is the quintessential White trash mom with a kind heart. She has a lot of darkness in her, but they do such a brilliant thing...and not make that the centralized burden to her life. She presses forward and referees two bulls. Though she is separated from her husband Mel, she harbors the right degree of resentment to a former relationship. The dynamics of their family are very clear.Any way, this is a surprisingly funny flick. I found myself laughing many times at some of the absurdity that occurs. Special shout-out to Teresa Ruiz who plays the love interest. She is warm, kind and when things go wrong, does exhibit the proper reaction and emotions. She is fantastic in this!Go check it out. I think you're going to be surprised.Stick around for a hilarious scene during credits.
good I saw this when it came out here Friday afternoon, had a bad morning at work, decided out of no where to stop at the theater, which I've not been to in years... I really enjoyed the movie, the acting, all of it. Not to much keeps my attention these days.. Sometimes the echo in the theater kept me from hearing something right, but I am gladly/anxiously waiting for this to come out streaming somewhere, just to watch again. If it comes out on DVD, i might even buy that. Very happy I went, someone, somewhere guided me to there for a reason.
good I haven't been to the theater to see a movie in years. I'm done with elitists morons in Hollywood. I saw Mark Wahlberg Mel Gibson and the word Father plus based on true story and I knew I'd pay to see this movie. I also know it won't get great reviews because Hollywood is stupid and look who they backed as President. I enjoyed this movie wAs ok with spending money to see it. I laughed and cried and I thank everyone who was involved in making this movie. The only way to fight the woke idiots is with our wallets.
good An excellent true story that's got a timely message for everyone today. If you haven't seen it, put it on the TOP of your MUST SEE list. Has ALL THE FEELS, LAUGH,CRY,SCREAM OUT LOUD! ðŸ¤£Yes, I did all of these!But... Not really a kids movie, Rated R, F-Bombs, he led a rough life, but great medicine for healing a broken heart. It has multiple levels that will touch every single person who sees it, no matter what your life has been like. Markie Mark & Melie Mel make a great Fr/Son complex relationship portrayal!!!#FrStu #GoodFriday #Easter #Truth
good Really enjoyed this film. It's surprisingly funny and made me laugh out loud quite a few times. Mark Whalberg gives an amazing performance and I got choked up at several scenes. Definitely enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting. This is how Christian movies should be made; raw, real, and in a way that everyone can relate to. Bravo!
good This was an amazing film. It was extremely inspiring, and very moving. The theatre was packed, and I heard many people crying. With a runtime of 2 hours and 4 minutes, some people might find it a little long. However, it was well worth it. The second half of the film really moved along nicely, and there were some funny scenes along the way. I really liked when Father Stu, Mark Wahlberg, went to speak to the prisoners. It was funny, and it showed how he had an excellent gift of connecting to people in a very simple way!
good I guess a lot of the movie critics were left a little bit cold by the film yet myself and the audience I was in had quite a different reaction. Most recent films I have watched seem to unspool with mostly indifference and forgettablity but this film evoked quite a bit of real heartfelt emotion and feeling that lasted long after walking out of the theatre. The difference here compared to other faith based films where the acting and direction is wooden and stilted with heavy handed didactic writing, this film seems grounded and utterly believable which gives it emotional heft and verisimilitude. Jacki Weaver and Mel Gibson are perfectly cast as the parents. It was quite refreshing to see working class people shown in a film without mockery,condescension or derision for a change. The one critique I have of the film is about the sound and the actors mumbling their lines where I think I missed maybe 30% of the dialogue. I was relieved when Malcolm McDowell showed up with his perfectly clipped British elocution.Mark Wahlberg usually only plays a version of himself in most films and here he is perfectly typecast in the early portrayal of the charismatic wastrel and jailbird failure that is a disappointment to his family Then he literally has a transformation with a Road to Tarsus incident becoming a new man that no one believes in or take seriously. Wahlberg here really lifts his game and showed me layers that I didn't think he was capable of in showing us the change in his character making him empathetic and moving. This film very much reminded me of the film from Poland called Corpus Christi where an exconvict on parole impersonates a priest in a small town. Where the young man learns he has gifts he didn't know he possessed and townspeople some forgiveness they had forgotten to give. Father Stu is an excellent film about how it is never too late for redemption, transformation and forgiveness. I would show this in a double bill with Martin Sheen's The Walk about a group of modern pilgrims doing the pilgrimage of the Camino de Santiago.
good I was hopeful when we went to see Father Stu last night...but I was not prepared for the depth of its various messages.Yes, there is lots of swearing (thus the R rating)...but that is who the guy actually was.Yes, it's very Catholic...because the guy became a Catholic and Wahlberg is a committed Catholic.But, despite those things...Father Stu had a few of the most simple yet profound Gospel explanations that I have seen in a film, Christian or otherwise.Additionally, the redemptive power of the Spirit is on full display as is the difficult subject of suffering vs. God's will and providence.I see every movie through a well developed Biblical worldview and process accordingly. Father Stu deeply touched my heart and Spirit, brought tears to my eyes several times, and left me almost speechless.I chose to Glorify God through the experience. I believe that is what Wahlberg has done to the best of his ability and understanding. I hope you will do the same.
ok An incredible directing /editing job by Rosalind Rossi's as her first directorial debut. Mark Wahlberg as Father Stuart "Stu" Long, Jacki Weaver as Kathleen Long, Mel Gibson as Bill Long, and especially Teresa Ruiz as Carmen with Malcolm McDowell adding great weight to the production. I was especially impressed by the editing sequence during the injury to Mark Wahlberg. I was not enjoying the rude and foul behavior by his character at the beginning but by the conclusion of the film I was extremely impressed and glad that I sat through the entire movie without stop.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Well, if you are going to make a movie about redemption and bettering one's self, who better to cast than Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson? Both men are stars who on multiple occasions have needed redeeming. Writer-director Rosalind Ross' first feature film is based on the true story of Stuart Long, and Mr. Wahlberg was so committed to the project that he funded production when others chose not to.OK, so maybe it's a bit of a stretch having Mr. Wahlberg play the guy who becomes a priest, but that's why they call it, "the magic of Hollywood." Stuart Long was a real person and his story is compelling and worth sharing. Wahlberg so believed this that he self-funded the production, and clearly gave his all in the performance. My advice to anyone watching the movie is to stay seated. Things move extremely fast ... and it's that expeditious approach to storytelling that gives this a bit of a movie-of-the-week feel. Here's what I mean by fast: We see Stu (Wahlberg) as a boxer. His parents are long-divorced, and after an injury, Stu decides to head to California to be an actor. He falls in love with a girl who convinces him to get baptized, and the experience inspires him to become a Catholic priest. Severe health issues ensue, yet he persists. That's a whole lot to cover in two hours, and it explains why each piece skims only the surface and feels rushed ... and this is only a partial list!The pedigree here is beyond question. Wahlberg has twice been Oscar nominated. Two-time Oscar winner Mel Gibson plays his father, while 2-time Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver is Stu's mother. Screen legend Malcolm McDowell plays the local monsignor who finds himself in a pickle, and the always-great Colleen Camp has a brief appearance as a seen-it-all motel clerk. Teresa Ruiz is terrific as Carmen, Stu's reluctant love interest who first think she understands him, then learns she doesn't, and then ultimately respects what he's made of himself.Catholicism plays a big role here, and there is plenty of guilt to go around. Wahlberg leans heavily into his charm to help us relate to Stu, but he and Gibson both have cringe-inducing moments for those familiar with some of their off-screen activities. Gibson's 'Hitler' crack seems to walk an especially fine line. On the other hand, Gibson delivers a couple of memorable lines: one early on when he's watching young Stu dance, and another later on when the two are re-connecting as grown men. Filmmaker Ross includes some actual Stuart Long audio recordings, photographs, and video over the closing credits.Opens in theaters April 13, 2022.
good A classic divide between the critics and the paying audience on this film. I found the performances by Weaver, Gibson, McDowell, and, yes, even Wahlberg to be very strong. Solid cinematography and a points some depth of dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, shed many a tear, and renewed my faith in humanity. The movie, like the actual Father Stu, blended together humour, wisdom, and meaning.
good The underlying story is one of a family who lost a child before the timeline of this movie...this destroys the family as it existed and starts Stu, dad, and mom down an irreversible course.Hollywood critics will surely balk at reviewing it at an accurate level since it deals with the truth of Hollywood sleaze and perversion.It doesn't shine a completely positive light on the Catholic Church but Hollywood doesn't really want anything remotely positive about the Church on the big screen...especially from A listers...
good Jesus continually spoke about how God is seeking the conversion of sinners. Fr. Stu is proof that it is never too late, redemption and forgiveness is available to everyone.It was a great movie- keeping the audience involved in the laughs and sadness.
good Isn't a Marvel fake story but an amazing real story movie. Was amazing seeing this with friends and family. The part where he tried to change was so deep.
ok 5.8/10The story itself was pretty inspirational with the whole fighting for what you believe in and going for something that you set your heart to, but the depiction falls short. Further, the religious aspect isn't overly pushy and works well as intended, but I can tell this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, like Stu's father in the movie.Mark Wahlberg is only convincing to a certain extent, but he didn't seem to fit the role all too well. Certain aspects came out stronger than others such as when he reaches a point of desperation, but he fails to capture the cockiness that he's shown in previous films.The cinematography is pretty good and captures the visuals essence quite well. The score was enjoyable too and made some points throughout more emotional. However, it took too long to get to the emotional points and caused me to lose interest very quickly.Overall, the film won't be to everyone's taste. It's a great story with a great moral, but the film depiction falls short to capture that essence. Marky Mark doesn't fit the role all to well, but he does have his moments.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!
good Loved this movie which is based on a true story. I thought it would be good from the trailers I watched, but I was blown away. So thankful to Mark Wahlberg for bringing Father Stu's story to the big screen. I can't recommend this movie enough.
good Went to see Father Stu and it was beautiful!! Everyone weeping... Not me of course"ðŸ˜­ 42% tomato score and 98% audience? Y'all need to be better educated in American culture. If a movie makes you cry or feel is an excellent movie ðŸ¿
good Mark was OUTSTANDING! Everyone sat in the theater after the movie ended. He could have used prosthetics for the weight gain but instead he did it the hard way. True Mark Wahlberg fashion.Absolutely loved it! Mark deserves an Academy Award for this movie.
good A top-tier film for me, a tale of many multitudes. It's a story that deviates from the typical Hollywood genre, I think everyone can relate to this film!
ok I saw Father Stu, starring Mark Wahlberg-Uncharted, the Daddy's Home movies; Mel Gibson-Daddy's Home 2, The Expendables 3; Teresa Ruiz-The Marksman, Cantinflas and Malcolm McDowell-Bombshell, Silent Night.This movie is based on a true story about Stuart Long, who went from being an amateur boxer to becoming a priest. Mark plays Stuart, a passionate man that gives everything his best shot. Mel is his father that left home when Mark was young and doesn't associate with Mark that much-there are hard feelings from both. Teresa is a Catholic girl that Mark falls for. He even starts going to church just to be around her. Malcolm is the Monsignor at the church. Mark has it rough when he decides to become a priest, mostly with his health-he has a disease-but he continues against odds to try to accomplish his goals. It's a testament to his faith and during the end credits, you see the real Stuart talking and learn what happened after the events shown in the movie.It's rated R for language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.It's an inspirational story but not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough. It would be a good rental just to see Mark's performance-he gained weight for certain scenes and even put up some of his own money to help finance the movie when no one else would.
ok There is a better film here but some unnecessary side plots - oh well, that romantic thing took the focus so many times - are really distracting.Some very good moments, great acting, very tense on its third act, but the first was confusing and full of exposition. Good enough but I was expecting better.
ok Operation Mincemeat is a film with very few bells and whistles.It has an interesting story to tell, and it tells it well enough, however unnecessary romantic subplots make the whole thing 20 minutes too long.I think the pacing is a little off as they place the focus too much on the establishment of the plan and not enough on how it pans out.The performances are all fine. Nothing overly flashy. There is a good feel to the film, capturing the period well.Overall a perfectly decent film, worth watching to learn about a remarkable and crucial military operation, but there's nothing particularly remarkable about the filmmaking.
ok I was so looking forward to this for the 2 years since i saw them starting filming in 2020 around WhitehallHuge chunks of this film were completely boring and totally unnecessary and these were the stultifying love relationships that took over the plot and in some ways took precedence over the whole point of the film.Ben Mackintires original book was miles away from this effort which - despite the cast - was as boring as hell and could have easily been the thrilling film it should have been leaving out 75% of the personal stories of the characters.The film focussed on the wrong things.What a shame.
ok "The Man Who Never Was" is a brilliantly crafted British wartime drama that told a true story,although that film introduced an unnecessary subplot about a German spy,it was still a great example of classic British film making. Why anyone decided to remake it is baffling,the new version contains many subplots that in real life did not happen and the fact the the subject matter is over 70 years old then why wait so long to remake it and why deviate from the source material ?.....I suppose we should be thankful that the Americans did not do the remake,it would have ended up with THEM single handedly winning the war.
ok I saw the original shortly after its release. Despite the fictional subplot about an Irish spy it is a far better film.Up to the moment that Martin is put in the sea the film is reasonably paced and interesting.. However after that a silly romantic subplot brings the film to almost a standstill. The last 20minutes could have been reduced to 5.It is difficult to understand why the film was remade,and why so many fictional elements were introduced.
good It's surprisingly light-hearted at times despite the subject matter, which can be a bit too much but Operation Mincemeat is still a great WW2 drama that's witty, fun and suitably suspenseful with a fascinating fact based story to explore.Colin Firth gives a great lead performance in a role that plays squarely to his strengths and is supported by Matthew Macfadyen who is successfully able to go toe to toe with Firth in the more dramatic moments. Kelly Macdonald and Penelope Wilton are also great, bringing genuine heart and warmth to the proceedings.John Madden's direction is excellent, establishing an engaging pace early on and maintaining it throughout helped by some effective cross cutting. The music by Thomas Newman is really good, tense, energetic and triumphant.
good Truly excellent, the story of how deception played such a key part in the Allies victory. Uniformly terrific performances and a great plot, demonstrating the "Wilderness of mirrors" of intelligence work, you can never really be sure of what is real and what is not and have to continually balance one risk against another. The ruthlessness of when the corpse's sister shows up and you have to put your nobler feelings aside because what you're doing is so much more important than her grief at her brother's death, that if you don't carry on there will be thousands of more grieving siblings to mourn for. The heart-stopping scene where the German agent confronts the heroine and you have to consider whether or not to continue, not knowing if there really is an anti-Hitler faction in German intelligence or whether this is all a bluff to make her spill her guts (the fact that he leaves her alive suggests the former). The nagging fear of Communist infiltration which turn out to be 100% true with Philby, Burgess and co. The references to the true inspiration for the plot, ex-British Intelligence chief Basil Thomson (one of the prime architects of the IRA's defeat) and his story "The Milner's Hat'. In truth the only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is that it somewhat exaggerates the impact of the scheme, had it not worked casualties in Sicily would have been far greater but it certainly wouldn't have affected the course of the war and there was no chance of a German invasion of Britain by 1943. But all told a classic spy story that I would recommend to anyone.
ok A likeable film however I can't help but feel for the potential that it missed out on. The actors fulfilled their roles and we were able to get to know the characters.The film often digressed from the main theme and and focused on far less relevant sub plots. Contrasting this some more interesting scenes felt to be cut short.The film is overall above par, however I feel this could have been so much more.
good Operation MincemeatWatched this at the Cineworld Unlimited screening and it was a big surprise. We have now had, quite unbelievably, three brilliant British movies in a row, Duke, Phantom of the Open and now this.Basically the movie showed us a secret spy type mission in WW2 that attempted to dupe the Nazis into believing a military lie and make a strategic mistake. The movie moved with ease from comedy to tragedy and back again with some very serious issues explored with a extraordinarily light touch.The screenplay was simply incredible with great narrative drive and believable characters.I shouldn't say it but it was refreshing that Churchill was portrayed as a corpulent caucasian and we didn't spend 20 minutes trying to guess who this was meant to be, clearly the woke diversity police weren't allowed to racially rinse or gender wash anyone in this movie. It was therefore all surprisingly realistic.The direction was masterful and breathed in all the right places, the actors shone throughout, it was totally an ensemble piece. For a long movie it flew by, I was gripped, even though in reality it was all a very dry subject.I'm giving this a 9 outta 10 for great entertainment, it wasn't perfect by all means and the romantic elements were all a bit stilted but I'm just being picky!
ok So, I finally got around to seeing this film after it's release & coming from someone who isn't a big War Film Fan, I found this film to be decent.The film sees Allies in 1943 launching an all-out assault on Fortress Europe code named Operation Mincemeat. But they face an impossible challenge - to protect a massive invasion force from entrenched German firepower and avert a potential massacre.I found the film to be watchable. It's not amazing or action packed, but it is a drama more focused on the planning & execution of the Operation & not a film focused on the actual Second World War itself. While wordy & talky, you roughly begin to understand what they're doing in the film & what is what, though at times it can get a bit confusing & muddled.The runtime is overly long at 2 hours & the pacing is all over the place in areas with parts slowing down & speeding up. The characters were good & distinguishable & the film isn't too badly made.Overall, it's not a bad film. It's watchable.5/10.
ok The production team clearly had an one too many during the making of this. Why anyone would add fiction to spoil a fascinating historical tale is beyond me.Lets recap -- the Brits decieved Hitler through brilliant trickery into diverting his troops, thereby losing ground to the allies, and ultimately losing the war. If this was pure fiction it would be unbelievable or better told with Marvel characters or Tarantino. However, it wasnt fiction!! So why litter the core story with contrived subplots? The relationship between Montague an Jean was nonsense. Unrealistic. Irrelevant. Was it perhaps because someone promised Colin it was a love story to get him involved? Add to this, whilst the script and dialogue was largely good, at times it was awful. These were brainfreeze moments. Casting and performances were generally good, especially Matthew M and Penelope Wilton.I did enjoy the movie but mainly because of the sheer fascination with the story, rather than the execution of this version of the story.
ok ... for this type of film; but unfortunately Operation Mincemeat failed to deliver in a similar way.Interesting story but as others have said far too much attention to the romantic subplot/ simmering jealousy, which at one point looked likely to derail everything.So in conclusion, a subpar effort.
ok Stiff upper lips, quiet heroism, and so on... Yes, all there.And the emphasis on the small back room boffins was appropriate. But there was no sense of real desperation - maybe you have had to have been a european film maker who experienced occupation for that.And why the childish insertion of a love story to ginger up the plot? Delete that and you would have had a tighter, more compelling one. If looking for emotion or pathos or the pity of war, which perhaps the love story was groping towards, surely the life and death of the man whose body became the man who never was might have provided that hook, if explored a little more thoroughly?There were flashes of wit - using Ian Fleming to frame his own plot was clever and Johnny Flynn's unerring ear did the voiceover well. The cast was full of excellent actors all of whom could deliver those lines and torpid plot points in their sleep.Is this the best that the British film industry can do? And why is the British film industry still fighting WW2? Can't we face up to the battles of the present and the yet to come?
ok It was enjoyable enough but I really wanted to enjoy this more than I did.It seemed to unnecessarily labour several male characters fancying Kelly Macdonald's character. All the time taken up on this tiresome sub-plot would have been better spent on some of the main story. Also, a triple-agent character giving a hand job to someone just seemed unlikely and out of place.One of several nods to James Bond was an unfeasibly high-powered buzzsaw watch as a throwaway gag (because of Ian Fleming being a character) was corny and distracting.I somehow expected it would be more engaging, gritty and revealing than the 1956 film, but it seemed pretty typical and formulaic like many modern British WWII themed films with foiled wartime romances crow-barred in.There are some great actors in the film but some of them seem to be overused in other similar roles the same era. It even seemed a little like a mini "Death of Stalin" reunion for Jason Isaacs and Simon Russell Beale.Perhaps I'm being too unkind to the film, but I was looking forward to it and fell a little short of expectations.
good A film packed with British talent,not the Big publicity blurb the yanks would have done. Script and acting at its best.the cinematography first Class.it shows that some of the war then and now was fought in the shadows.
ok I was really looking forward to this film because it's based on the book of the same name by Ben Macintyre, which was brilliant.It starts off very strong, setting the scene, as in wartime Britain and at what point of the war it is, and highlighting the importance of the mission that the main characters will do.Unfortunately as other reviewers have said the main plot of the movie is not the focus at times and instead it focuses on, frankly, irritating sub-plots. The strength of the film is the intelligence work that the characters do and that should have been the focus.The acting was great. I particularly liked, Jason Isaacs as John Godfrey a naval commander and Simon Russel Beale as Winston Churchill.Overall, worth watching, especially if you normally like World War Two dramas or spy stories, but potentially could have been better I think.
good Not your average war film, but a story brilliantly told.The film from end to finish was fantastic and told the story of operation mincemeat very well.
bad Having watched all the other mincemeat films, but yet also having an appreciation for historical accuracy, it's still hard to give this film a great review. Whether it was the overly familiar attitudes from secretaries, or the poor way the blackout was portrayed, with many lights outside buildings shown as being on - this would not have been the case. There were other inconsistencies too numerous to mention, but a basic one which struck me was the way 2 of the cast returned a salute, despite not wearing hats - this would not have happened, but instead they would have come to attention for the duration of the salute offered.The overdevelopment of the romantic subplot was, I thought, highly likely to not have been historically true, and, although Montagu's wife did indeed think he may have been having an affair, this part of the film detracted hugely from the main tale. It was as if the someone couldn't be bothered with including a really good visual description of mission and instead decided to involve a romantic element to take up the time. This in itself made the film a massive disappointment.The camera work was great, but somehow the whole thing lacked a feeling of warmth, it was as if the set was just filmed and that was it. The way the film appeared on screen was cold, thin and lacked the rich lustre that so often adds so much to historical films.The 1956 film based on Ewen Montagu's book of the same title: "The Man Who Never Was", is, I feel, far superior to this film even though it may not be quite so historically accurate, and is a great watch for anyone who has an interest in seeing a far, far better film about this subject.The 2010 BBC documentary, hosted and narrated by Ben Macintyre who wrote a book on the subject is likewise excellent. Sadly, this latest film falls a bit short despite being overall more historically accurate in the big details, whilst really falling down in regards of various minutiae - so much so that I'll have to watch the film a second time in the future and physically list all the minute factual discrepancies that made me groan with disappointment.One could put them down to 'goofs', but there were so many they really need to be all grouped together and called laziness or inaccuracy or perhaps laziness and inaccuracy in the interests of trying to make a more watchable film. Sadly this didn't work.
ok A bit of a strange one. I liked it. I enjoyed it. But yet I found it a little slow. The acting was good and kept me entertained - and yet - I could have hoped for a bit more 'drama'. Nonetheless a good film even more intriguing because it was based on a true story.
ok The real life story is interesting and if it was told as a 60 minute episode of a WW2 documentary series I would be engaged. However, as a 2 hour movie this is a complete failure. Those 2 hours felt like 4 and I couldn't wait for it to wrap up. The main problem of this film is its boring cast of characters and their extremely dull sub-plots. Not for a moment did I care about what happens to any of them. There are some moments that can be considered somewhat exciting. When they happen You think that the film will start to get better but no, it quickly goes back to being mundane and uninspired.What also contributes to its complete drabness is the monotonous and sleep inducing way in which the movie is shot. Seriously, there is nothing to be applauded here. The only reasons for my "high" rating are learning about this operation and that the movie is somewhat competent and that the cast do their best with what they were given. I'm sure there are videos or articles on the internet which You can find that explain the operation if anyone's interested but don't watch Operation Mincemeat unless You feel like having a nap in the cinema.
ok A true war time spy thriller that tells its story with very little flair. It picks up in the second half as the plot(s) begin to unravel, but the heavy focus on the love story wasn't that interesting. There are some good moments and the acting is solid throughout, but it could have done with more tension, humour or drama.
ok Having read the book I was worried that the film may be over dramatic or try to rewrite history but they did it proud. It is believable and not overly dramatic.There is a great list of characters and the whole plot is explained well. It is a a little known key story in the course of the war that deserves to be told.A fine British film that is well worth a watch.
good Although ive not seen the Film yet i did notice a mistake in the trailer,the Red Wax Seal is showing a Queens Crown & not a Kings Crown. Only a small mistake i know,but one that of easily been prevented.
ok Recently I have watched the tv version of the Ipcress File.I doubted the point of making the Ipcress File series but it was good and was not just a remake and likewise this is not exactly a remake of The man who never was,a film from 1956.I give no plot spoilers but I assume people know this is a world war 2 story.This film is well acted and it looks great.I didn't spot any obvious historical errors.But as much as I enjoyed the film I say it could have been better.I say it could have been better because the script was flawed but it is still worth watching.
ok I saw the original film version of this story 'The man who never was' some years ago on TV and it is a fascinating yet gruesome story.This version, whilst updating the legend and correcting some of the things the 1956 film may have got wrong (such as the fictional IRA sympathizer who checked out the deception) is still not quite the complete picture. The cast do their jobs and the acting is solid but the lack of cinematic scope still makes it feel like it comes up a bit short. Maybe I was unfavorably comparing it to the excellent 'The Imitation Game' from a few years back which tells the story of the race to decrypt the secret Nazi Enigma codes, a film that was also hampered by a lack of visual action but had a much sharper script than we have here.Don't get me wrong, the real Operation Mincemeat was an amazing feat of bluff and the effort put into it by those concerned is truly commendable. But somehow I get the feeling this would probably have worked better as a mini series as it has the feel of one.This is not to say this is not a worthwhile film and is well worth a watch. It's just that I felt they fell slightly short of correcting the inaccuracies of Ronald Neame's 1956 version (which I recommend). All I feel they've done is replace one slightly inaccurate version with another version that is inaccurate in a different ways, and added an unnecessary romantic subplot. Perhaps the facts themselves alone are too dry to use as the only basis for the script but it just feels a little forced.I guess I probably expected a little too much from this film. The 1956 version of events is an entertaining film in its own right and also has some good performances but was hampered in its facts by the fact that many of the facts were still top secret at the time so it had to speculate (and fairly accurately as it turns out). This 2021 version doesn't have that excuse, but it still deviates for cinematic reasons. It is definitely worth watching both films though.On the whole I think this is a good film but it lacks pace and tension in parts and sometimes gets bogged down in places with unnecessary character exposition. Having said that I'm still glad I saw it.
good This is NOT a casual watch, nor is it really a horror film in the traditional sense. You Won't Be Alone is so bizarre, unconventional, and sometimes grotesque that I'm honestly baffled that it got funding. But I'm very glad that it did.It's technically a witch movie, but it's also kind of an alien movie. Let me explain...No spoilers here, but the premise follows a young witch in the 19th century who was kept isolated from humanity until adulthood, then experiences what it's like to be human for the first time by taking over the bodies of villagers and living out their lives.The rest of the film is a soulful meditation that is essentially an alien observing how humans think, feel, and how they treat one another. It gives a very unique perspective on the simple things in life that we often take for granted, both good and bad.It made me grateful for the full spectrum of human pleasures and pains-happiness and heartbreak.The weirdness of the witch elements and the story's slow pace will definitely turn a lot of people off. The fact that a good chunk of the film just portrays normal simple lives being lived makes some moments feel rather repetitive. Sometimes I found myself thinking "I get the point, and I like the point, but let's move on now."Still, this is one of those films that had such ambition that I can't help but admire it-even the small stuff I didn't personally care for.If you are in a thinking mood, this is a soulful, dark drama that will certainly satisfy.
ok Greetings again from the darkness. Perhaps you are a normal movie lover and have never wondered what it might be like if director Terrence Malick delved into the horror genre. Well, the first feature film from writer-director Goran Stolevski gives every indication that he has spent entirely too much time with such thoughts. This arthouse folk horror film will likely frustrate many with its unconventional approach, odd narrative, and spiritual narration that hardly contributes to the characters in the story.Opening in a remote mountain village in 19th century Macedonia, we witness a 'Wolf-eatress" witch named 'Old Maid Maria' (Anamarie Marinca; 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS, 2007) visiting a mother (Kamka Tocinovski) and her newborn baby. It turns out Maria has a taste for newborn blood, but the mother negotiates a deal which would allow her to raise her daughter Nevena until Maria takes her in teen years. The child is then hidden away in a cave, isolated for years and mostly feral when Maria returns. Teenage Nevena (Sara Klimoska) knows nothing of the outside world and sets out on her journey of life lessons, guided by Maria, a witch who may or may not have her best interests at heart.Shape-shifting, or assuming the form of their victims is a trait that Maria passes along to her protÃ©gÃ©. This process is quick and brutal, and we see it played out along the way as Nevena takes over a local mother (Noomi Rapace), so as to get a taste of normalcy, a wolf (just because?), a man (Carlota Cota) so as to absorb power and experience sex, and a young woman (Alice Englert) in order to give birth to a child. This shape-shifting is referred in the movie as "dressed in corpse", which is a spot-on description. The Wolf-eatress follows closely, but does give her new daughter the space to explore humans, though Maria does not share the appeal.There are some excellent scenes in the film, but it leaves the impression of trying too hard to come across as Malick doing horror. Still, with some similarities to Robert Eggers' horror gem, THE WITCH (2015), there is enough atmosphere of terror to keep us engaged and working through the often-confounding narration. As a bonus, it leaves us with the perfect final line, "And yet ..."
good When picking out my Sundance festival lineup, this was one of my top two picks.This film is so much more then horror. It's a deep dive into what it is to exist.In the very beginning a mothers child is tainted by a witch, out of fear she hides her daughter into some sort of cavelike rock formation.I found the beginning to be a metaphor for Plato's cave. Living your most impressionable years in a rock formation unable to leave, only learning from the limited scope of your world.Eventually the witch who tainted the child returns to free her from her mothers rule.Through various lenses, (a mother/wife, a dog, a man, a child who grows into an adult) she learns what it is to exist. What love, anger, fear, and exhaustion are. She learns of the discrimination of women and what sisterhood is. Then as a man tries to help understand the inherited misogyny.However the film really takes off when she transforms into the child. She is able to help inhabit this child's body until early adulthood. It's then that she learns that there was always more for her then what was provided. She learns curiosity, playfulness, and the importance of family. But most of all she learns of love.However lurking in the background of her experiences is the witch, foreboding that all of these attempts will fail.However one's experience is not the others. We learn of a folklore tale that is actually the true story of how the witch came to be. It is full of betrayal and brutality.The end climaxes in a standoff with the women and the witch. The witch asks how it was so easy for her (with a home, a (recently murdered by the witch) husband and a child). She doesn't answer, but the answer is clear.She used her powers to understand life. The witch used hers for revenge and torment.A metaphor to me of how good triumphs evil through the power of empathy and understanding.
ok Saw this back at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival.The story is about a young witch in the 19th century who was kept isolated from humanity until adulthood, then experiences what it's like to be human for the first time by taking over the bodies of villagers and living out their lives. Australian director Goran Stolevski takes influence on experimental, artsy and cinematic horror movies from the past and tries to create his version of witchcraft horror like "The Witch". However, unlike "The Witch", "You Won't Be Alone" suffers from a really basic narrative and felt really repetitive as it goes on. Stolevski no doubt is trying his best which I applaud him for doing so. But the problem is that it relies way too much on the beauties of the camerawork, production, and performances which overshadows the story and characters.The production costumes that sets the period of Macedonian culture is interesting, most of the performances are pretty good besides a few of them being really bad, and some really good visual effects that looked really good. The actors portraying the main character was an interesting choice I must say. These positive aspects are overshadow by an repetitive annoying soundtrack that didn't fit the tone of the film at all, uninteresting characters that I wish were given enough depth but unfortunately had no emotionally barring to connect with, and the narration provided felt like the movie didn't know how to find creative ways to present the story so they just gave us exposition instead of allowing the audiences to be creative and think about it.The almost 2 hour runtime pretty much doesn't feel worth it as this film would work if it was trimmed down. Because there are several scenes that almost felt like filler and had no purpose but to fill out the runtime. Stolveski wasn't able to create a masterpiece here and it ends up becoming forgettable by the end of the day. This is someone who loves weird horror movies and slow burn thrillers. But this one was disappointing, but I do believe that there is still something to value in this movie. It's just didn't do it for me.Rating: C-
good Normal movie goers will hate this for its slow pace, subtitles, lack of dialogue and its 'show don't tell' style of plot exposition. Fans of cinematic art will love it for the same reasons.It wouldn't surprise me if this gets remade in the an English language version as the plot is unique and scary enough.The director is obviously inspired by Terence Malick movies and the folk horror element is drawn from movies like Robert Eggers' The Witch.I found this to be enthralling, surprising and one of the most inventive movies I've seen this year.
good Caught an advance screening tonight, never have I felt such a palpable energy in a theater of normies not enjoying a movie so much it hurts. Yes people did leave. It's subtitled, and slow, and beautiful. And makes you ponder life, and existence, and beauty, and pain. If you want a one dimensional summer blockbuster this ainttttttt it.That being said, if you love folk horror, atmospheric horror, art house, Eggers, Aster, Von Trier, etc, you will love it :)
good I was impressed by the unusual storyline as a woman attempts to fit in with normal people even though she is a witch with abnormal abilities. The cast is excellent and scenery spooky. Rapace leads the ensemble and everyone is up to the task. The film is in Serbian and the subtitles are at times not grammatically correct. Even so, I rank this as a top tier horror movie.
good I had no idea what this movie was about when I stumbled across it. I just saw horror as a genre and Noomi Rapace underneath the title and as I like both I though I would give it a go. Before I watch anything, I generally check the rating on IMDB without reading any reviews and as this had a score of above 6/10 on IMDB it confirmed my decision so I pushed play.I quite like Noomi but her last movie, Lamb, left me a bit disappointed so I was keen to see if this one was any better."Packaged" as a horror (a character deemed to be a witch, some blood and gore) this really is a reflection on life. It unfolds like a David Attenborough documentary and the filmography is just as fantastic even if it is in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The main character was raised in cave with no human interaction except seeing her mother for an hour or so a few times a week until the age of 16. She then departs her prison and we journey with her through life as she learns both the good and bad of human nature and emotion.I don't generally like dramas but this had me spellbound. It is slow and you need to give this all of your attention to be rewarding. The TikTok generation will quit after the first 5 minutes and I won't try to persuade them. For the "more mature" folk who have finished a few seasonal cycles in life and who have loved, was loved, lost love, was bullied, ridiculed and outcast - there is a lot to reflect on.Give this one a watch. It is the best movie I seen this year.
good YOU WON'T BE ALONE (2022) *** Sara Klimoska, Noomi Rapace, Anamaria Marinca, Alice Englert. An outstanding horror film that is more of a think piece folktale/Grimm's fairy tale, than genre flick that takes place in 19th century Macedonia where a witch makes a pact with a woman to spare her baby until she reaches her 16th birthday and then comes back to claim her debt which in turn has the feral girl experience a truly unsettling life experience. Filmed with elegiac imagery and a poetic pace thanks largely to the creative talents of its filmmaker Goran Stolevski in his directorial debut and Matthew Chuang's painterly touch in cinematography.
good Dark, slow, disturbing, poetic, beautifully shot, tender, makes you ponder your existence, and one of the best portrayals of a witch I have seen.Watched at Cinema 21.
good This is a movie that I got turned on to when looking at movies that were horror and playing at Sundance Film Festival. I put it down on a list of potential movies to see. When I saw that this was coming to the Gateway Film Center, I asked my wife if she was interested in seeing this one. She confirmed, so we went opening night. I had read her the synopsis coming in so that was about the extent of what I knew. For this movie, we are in an isolated mountain village in 19th century Macedonia where a young girl is kidnapped and then transformed into a witch by an ancient spirit.To preface this, we don't get a lot of dialogue. What we do is mostly given through voice-over narration. We start with a cat that journeys to a village. A group of children are playing hide-and-seek. They annoy a woman who lives and she sends them away. She has a baby that I believe is named Nevena. Things take a turn when Old Maid Maria (Anamaria Marinca) appears. She is a local witch who is covered in scars. We learn what caused them later. The mother pleads with her to leave the baby until she is sixteen. From that point on, she can have the child. Maria agrees to these terms. Before she goes, she injuries the infant. Jaime wasn't sure what happened here, but I believe she rips her tongue out.The mother then hides her child in a sacred cave. There are drawings on the wall so I'm guessing this is a primitive church of sorts. She leaves the baby there and then goes into the village, calling out that a wolf ate her child. Nevena grows up to be played by Sara Klimoska. She is dancing around this cave as her form of entertainment. She is limited in not being able to leave. Her mother visits her, bringing her food. Nevena wants to go with her mother but is scolded. She fears for what will happen if her daughter does.Everything changes when a hawk comes into the cave. When Nevena's mother shows up, she believes it to be Maria. The mother chases after it and we hear a noise. Maria then appears. She takes Nevena with her. During their travels, Maria curses this younger woman and then tries to teach her the ways that she survives. This repulses Nevena and Maria abandons her. Nevena learns through spying on Maria how to shape-shift. We then see Nevena taking the form of a woman, a man and even child to survive. She also learns humanity that she missed out on due to her isolated upbringing. She also learns heartbreak.That is where I'm going to leave my recap. There isn't a lot to the story as it is more of following Nevena as she takes the form of a few different people. I debated going a bit deeper into things here, but I don't want to give things away. Personally, I don't think it would hurt to know. Some people who read my reviews like to come in knowing as little as possible, which is why I'm playing this closer to the vest.Where I will start then with my breakdown is that this is an interesting time. We don't know for sure, but as the synopsis stated, we are in the 1800s. The people that we are following are peasants. Their lot every day is to ensure they have food. We see Bosilka (Noomi Rapace) give birth then at once go back into the field to work. This is a hard life. It is a shame to have a vengeful witch like Maria praying on these people as they don't have much. Maria is an interesting character that I will circle back to.I will focus first though on Nevena. She is cursed as a baby. First by her mother to protect her. I thought it was interesting that she would carry on that her baby was taken. She is sets plans in motion to hide and protect Nevena. It doesn't work of course. The problem though is that it stunts her daughter's growth. She never learns to speak. I have reason to believe her tongue was ripped out due to one of the forms she takes later in the movie. If she hadn't, I think she could learn. The different forms that she takes are interesting. It gives her life experiences that one person couldn't get in a lifetime. When Jaime and I were talking at the end, that was an intriguing thing to have here. It also showed some things that Jaime pointed out.What I mean there is how people are treated. It is in a way here that I wasn't expecting. When Nevena takes on the form of a woman, she no longer can speak. The people that know her just believe this to be a 'woman' affliction. It doesn't bother them. This does get awkward to the point where I was uncomfortable since Nevena doesn't know how to act around them. When she takes the form of a male, they think he's possessed by evil spirits and try to exorcise them. This was fascinating to me. Reflecting on this, they needed the man more so him acting differently, they tried to save him. For the woman, they just chalked it up to her changing. Nevena's best cover is as a child. This works, because when she took her over, something bad happened to her. This becomes the most heartbreaking for her though as well. I thought this made for interesting social commentary here for the different things Nevena experienced.Now I'll come back to Maria. From the beginning, we get the idea that she is known as a witch. We learn later that she is a legend and ghost story of sorts in the area. Maria is a bitter woman who kills for food. A few different people point out to her about wanting a child. When we learn the tale, we get to see her backstory play out. I'm glad they did this. By the end of the movie, I said to Jaime that I felt bad for her. She did point out that it doesn't justify the horrible things that she did and she's right. We see that Maria got a raw deal. She was older during this era and was considered an 'old maid'. The man that wanted to marry her wasn't what she was expecting. His family did something horrible to her. She tried to get what she wanted, but it backfired. Humanizing her is a strategic thing to do here to complicate her character for me.That should be enough for the story so I'll go over to the acting, which I thought was good. Rapace is an actor that I've never seen do anything bad. Her performance is good for the range that she shows. I like Englert as well. She was cute despite the rough life she is living. One of the best performances is Marinca. She is such a villain through most of it. Once we learn of her past, it makes a lot of sense why. Kilmoska is solid. I like all those that are playing the possessed versions to mimic how Nevena acted in the beginning. That was well done. Other than that, I'd say the rest of the cast was solid to round this out for what was needed. They do well in pushing our leads to where they needed to end up for sure.All that is left are the cinematography, effects and the soundtrack. For the former it is great. We get some beautiful shots. This was well played. Pulling in the effects, it feels like we are seeing these characters live in the past. That was impressive to me. I also think the focus of the shot is good to hide effects. We get to see Maria changing into different things, some of which on camera. I did enjoy that. We get blood that looks good. There are claws that are witches have. They were fine for the most part. There were just a couple times I could tell they were fake. It was practical so I'll give credit there. Other than that, I thought the soundtrack fit. It helped to build the atmosphere when needed for me.In conclusion, this movie is one that I'm glad I waited until the next day to get my thoughts down. I liked this leaving the theater, but the more I think about it, the more I did. We have an interesting period piece here. We are seeing a witch alter the life of a young woman and the effects it has on her. There is interesting commentary that Nevena learns through this. The acting is good across the board. The best performance being Marinca. It feels like we are in the era it took place. The cinematography is great and the soundtrack fits for what was needed. This movie is a slow burn. Be aware of that. I don't think everyone will like this one, to the point where I can see it being polarizing. If you like a bit more meat on the bone for your viewing, see this one.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.
good This is not a Noomi Rapace vehicle. Instead, she fits into the ensemble seamlessly. And even though there are some lambs in it, it does not resemble Lamb (2021). Granting credence to the witchcraft and magic stuff does something way beyond delivering a cheap thrill: it puts the viewer into the mindset of that dark ages Serbian village. Those people would have been dead certain that they saw fingernails become claws, or mistaken a woman badly burned in a bungled witch-burning for a spectral being. The tools and textiles of that pre-pre-industrial village are exquisitely authentic. All this is well worth the candle--even if those villagers did not have candles. The only film I think it compares with is La guerre du feu (1981).
good After making a covenant with the witch who came to take her baby girl, a mother hides the girl away ... until the fateful day arrives.I spent the first twenty minutes silently noting that movies need action, even the meaningful kind of movie - especially the meaningful kind. Then I fell under a spell, and this thing just glided by in all its glory. The fairy-tale effect gradually gains substance, until the sense of life in death and death in life winds around itself.I suppose it's a picaresque tale, cycling through to the original scene, but rather than move from situation to situation, it's from body to body. The obscure voice-over seems to have a similar function to the score, which itself is subtle and interesting. And there really is nothing more fascinating on screen than the human face - and here the camera hardly ever leaves it as we switch through the actors.Folk horror is not my favourite, and The VVitch I found kinda tedious, but this is way superior. It may just be that I dig the Slavic vibe of peasant macabre: The Viy, Come and See, III, even Valerie and Her Week of Wonders - all fascinating in their way, and this is up there with them.Performances, camera work, sound design are all excellent, and the sense of mucky enchantment in the landscape is nicely done. So, despite my inability to explain what this is all about, I give it the full recommendation.
good Just saw this at our local arthouse cinema. An astonishing film, and all the more so for being the director's feature-length debut. Complex and tightly-woven storytelling without a single wasted shot. First-rate ensemble acting and a score to match. Horror, yes, but with a palpable sense of longing that takes the story beyond the genre into something far more grand and sweeping. A friend described it as Hagazussa meets Tree of Life and that's as good a description as you're likely to find. It's going to stick with me for a good while--haunting, beautiful, and subtly profound.
bad When I sat down to watch the 2022 drama horror "You Won't Be Alone" from writer and director Goran Stolevski, it was without ever having heard about the movie, nor knowing anything about it aside from what the synopsis managed to present.But I figured that with it being a Macedonian language based movie, and a horror movies nonetheless, that I hadn't already seen, of course I found the time to sit down and watch it. And truth be told, then I found the movie's cover/poster to be somewhat alluring and interesting.And while "You Won't Be Alone" definitely started out okay and seemed to have potential, the movie quickly fell into a slow trot and never really picked up pace. And while I am not familiar with Indo-European folklore and superstitions, then "You Won't Be Alone" proved to be somewhat of a drag to sit through. And worse still, was the fact that the movie was so incredibly slow paced and rather uneventful.Sure, there were aspects to the storyline that was actually good and nicely told, but the overall picture here was just one of the movie not really falling into my liking.I will say, however, that the acting performances in "You Won't Be Alone" were good. Needless to say that I wasn't familiar with a single performer on the cast list here, aside from Noomi Rapace.Ultimately, while I did manage to sit through all of "You Won't Be Alone", then it wasn't a movie that particularly entertained me. And this is not a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time, nor is it a movie that I would recommend you rush out to get to watch.My rating of writer and director Goran Stolevski's "You Won't Be Alone" lands on a very generous three out of ten stars.
ok Amazingly enough I saw this film at a local AMC during its limited run. This film is very much a cross between The Witch (2015) and Under the Skin (2013). It is very slow moving and methodical but follows a coherent plot. A very visual film and though it has a narrator there isn't as much as emphasis on dialogue. If you enjoy folklore, A24 type horror films then this is worth your time. This film has a very narrow audience and will not appeal to many people. You have been warned.
ok What I did like : creative story, with a good direction and a somewhat feel good ending. Decent effects, and visuals.What I didn't like : a clashing score that changes on a dime, ASMR narration, would have been better as a short film, felt bloated clocking in just under 2 hours.
bad A Macedonian language arthouse horror drama with a clever form of storytelling within the low budget limitations and yet it looked phenomenal and fantastic. A grounded realistic witch tale with mesmerizing music, atmospheric locations and a brilliant cast. It's not really a full-blown horror film. An emotional drama filled with trauma and grief.
ok The basic concept is concrete and intense.However, the execution failed to inject the same to the viewer.It is slow paced, and the initial phase is a bit off the element to grab your attention.
ok Good movie to watch for especially the movie deals with the practices of witchcraft during early 1900's period the movie is a gimme tale nice picturisation.
good From reading the reviews here it is clearer than ever that a lot of people just don't enjoy or understand movies like this. It's a perfect example of why I always watch films I'm interested in and not base decisions on others opinions. To me this film is a tale of human life based around an outsiders point of view that has no previous understanding of emotions, love, loss, tragedy etc. She is cursed with little if any chance to be happy in life forever no matter who she is and what path is taken, but like all of mankind, learns as she goes. We as humans enjoy good times, but will always face tough and even horrible times. Even though we know these events are inevitable we persevere and continue on life's journey. So that's what I got from the film, maybe I'm way off? I don't think so though. Is it a movie I'd watch over and over again? Maybe one more time but probably not more than that. Am I glad I watched it, YES. It has my mind whirling a decent amount. It's not a "lets watch a fun Halloween horror flick movie" and definitely not a date night movie. It's slow and requires a good night sleep before hand. That said, I never felt like it was a waste of time like some people have said. You have to enjoy the idea that myths are based on real life's horrors. Being alone in this world can be scarier than any horror story monsters ever can be.
good I was watching and bearly believing it. It's like Bela Tarr, Robert Eggers, and Terrence Malik decided to make a film together, and this is the product. A living, moving poem! A fearless work of uncompromised vision! It's Art at its purest!It's a small film in terms of production value, but with its humble means of making a movie, it can awaken some of the most powerful emotions you'll ever experience watching a film. The film examines human nature; what it means to be human in an original, elevated cinematic language. Sure, the cinematography and the camera-work in its entirety may come off as a bit hurriedly, not very well thought out. But what it lacks in visuals, the film makes up for it with its tender score, raw acting performances, and unflinching direction.'You Won't Be Alone is a film you can't talk much about without interpreting it. I think people will come out of the movie with different interpretations of it, and as far as I am concerned, that's one of the most luxurious qualities of a film as long as that's the filmmaker's goal with it. And that's what this film implied to me. Goran Stolevski embraces one of the most daring storytelling techniques, "don't tell, show," and navigates through this bizarre endeavor not like it's his debut film but a career-peek masterpiece. It's a challenging film. The slow pace, the unwarned jumps in time, and characters showing up without introductions would all present limited appeal to the masses. But to those in the right frame of mind to delve fully into it, the film it'll be a satisfying encounter. It's cinema for the feeling, not for the superficial intellect. The film feels designed to be an experience for the soul. And to think, cinema of these proportions is being made so close to me - it's a Macedonian film, set in the 19th or 20th century Macedonia, and it stays so close to the Albanian-similar Macedonian folklore - thrills me.
good We are all born in the cave our parents made from their believes, when we find out we can Think, reasoning and choose for ourselves we start our own journey.A wise person will go toward the light even if the devil made a deal with your ancestors about you.There is no god helping you in this way except your intellection.The first years of her life n the cage is an outside example of the parental control system based on their fears.Coming out and exploring the world is when a child stand against dictation.Facing the truth in a male, female and a child body is the reality of life.Defeat the devil is when you figure out humanity is the best religion.
