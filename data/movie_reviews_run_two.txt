10 The Northman's combination of a large budget and epic scale with a slow burn character drama make it an incredibly unique and rare film. A disturbingly violent yet breathtakingly beautiful exploration of the cycle of violence and it's burden on those it consumes.Alexander Skarsgård gives a phenomenal lead performance, full of a ridiculously intense physicality balanced with a visible pain and trauma. Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible with steely eyed determination and Claes Bang is terrific, bringing depth and nuance to a possibly one note character.Robert Eggers' direction is excellent, full of satisfyingly long takes, visceral action and some truly surreal imagery. The music by Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan is perfect, skillfully switching between bombastic, haunting and beautiful.
9 As it is kind of becoming Eggers trademark, you either love or hate his movies. This one is no different.Is it a realistic viking representation? I wouldn't know I'm no expert on that area, but I don't think that is the point of the film. It is definetely not trying to be realisticly accurate.Is it slow at times, kind of weird, and brutally shocking? Yes that is an Eggers film as it core. Be aware of that.Is it a very enjoyable, compeling, emotional, dramatic and somehow fantastical film about the obsession of revenge and destiny? Yes, absolutely.
8 It was finally time, Robert Eggers "The Northman" one of my if not the most anticipated movie of 2022 for me.I was i little bit worried that this movie wouldn't feel like a Robert Eggers movie now that there was some big companies involved in this, but boy was i wrong. The Northman feels just like a Eggers movie but with a bigger budget, and wow what a fantastic movie this was. A dark,brutal and Violent vikings tale with some incredibly beautiful shots and a Swedish viking in the lead role.The Northman feelt like a crossover betweeen The Green Knight and Gladiator and it might already be one of the best movies of the year.
9 An epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of Norse mythology. Its intense rituals, powerful imagery, guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience. Stunning scenery, brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
10 Robert Eggers does it again! This isn't just another viking movie, it is one of the BEST dramas ever! GREAT action & emotional too. A fitting end, while also setting up what's next. It is a stunning tale of betrayal and obsessive revenge. With excellent world building saturating every frame, it's one of the most transporting, magical, action-soaked films in some time. Must watch. 10/10.
9 Like his memorable period piece freak-outs "The Witch" and "The Lighthouse," though on a vastly more ambitious scale, bloody and deliciously violent. The Northman is a big-budget epic, but it retains those indie roots, and in " Robert Eggers " fashion , very aesthetically pleasing. This film delivers ! Powerhouse performances and otherworldly imagery . I highly recommend at some point to see this blood-soaked odyssey !! Sooner rather than later. A cinematic saga. The cast in this one is absolutely incredible. Check out the cast ....
The Northman starring Alexander Skarsgard, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, and Björk.
8 It's intense, dark, brutal and fierce! The ultimate story about blood vengence. Unlike the Vikings show (History channel) this movie is actually pretty authentic in terms of depicting the viking culture and lifestyle. Eggers certainly has put a lot of his signature storyteliing touch on it which gives the film a unique character. Perhaps not for everybody but most people will probably find it intereating and refreshing!
9 Robert Eggers, who watched the epic movie "The Juniper Tree" at the age of 14 and decided to become a director, is now a director who makes epic films. After he proved it with "The Northman", Robert Eggers was promoted to the side of those gods from a good regulation that follows the gods of cinema. A magnificent art direction, a unique cinematography, impressive musical scores, actors and actresses each serving a purpose...
8 Young director Robert Eggers is back at it again with his most recent take on a movie based around vikings, now first of all I have to give full credit to the film when it comes to capturing the brutality of vikings because it is done spectacularly. The film itself is entertaining and the cast delivers great performances all around, this role shows that Alexander Skarsgård has what it takes to be a top tier dramatic actor as he arguably delivers a career-high performance.Now for people contemplating whether or not they should see the film because Eggers' films so far have been "too artsy" and "not for the general audience" should put their worries aside and purchase their tickets because there isn't much to worry about even though there will be many classic Eggers shots he is typically known for.As for the small negatives about the film; I felt disappointed in how little we got of Dafoe as he often shines with these types of directors. I do also have to say that the movie isn't exactly how it is shown in the trailers (less action in the final product), some people claim the trailers are superior and even though I enjoyed my time in the cinema I slightly agree with those claims.
8 Brutal, dirty and a bit monotonous. The film is reminiscent of Valhalla Rising in its direct and merciless brutality - In which Mads Mikkelsen gives a facelift in a similarly harsh world of animal violence.A similar picture is drawn in Robert Egger's film, in a simple yet banal revenge story. Yes, the violence of the first part of the film is gripping. And yes, the whole thing is excellently implemented. Very different from Vikings pop cinema or some other Viking cinema. But in the end, violence alone is not enough to tell a good story. The director did better in his two previous films. But it remains a bloody and visually stunning spectacle that you should have seen.
10 From the first frame you know that "The Northman" will not be an ordinary movie. Robert Eggers returns with another masterful story far removed from the horror genre (although with some present touches of this genre) and explores an epic story whose excellently written script surprises with each scene and each sometimes theatrical dialogue. The filming locations are tremendous and together with the first level cinematography, the costume design and a spectacular production they achieve a trip to the past and to the mythology of the Vikings. Eggers' film directing excels at every second and the performances are delightful, especially Nicole Kidman's, possibly the best performance of her career. The soundtrack is deep, the special effects shine from how excellent they are. "The Northman" is so far the best film of this 2022 and it can hardly be dethroned. Talking about this movie deserves nothing but praise, an instant classic!
8 Everything about this movie screams "beastly." Literal screams along with metaphorical ones. It's a beastly movie with a beastly cast giving beastly performances behind a backdrop of beastly cinematography scored with beastly music.I had a smile on my face for most of the movie. I was fully invested in the story and characters. The directing is top-notch with a style that gives the movie a character of its own. There are so many beautiful shots. And I give it major props for going all out and holding nothing back (we need more R-rated movies!!).In my review for Dune, I mentioned that so many scenes feel so epic even without action. Regular scenes of them walking are somehow epic. It's the same way with The Northman. It's filled with epic non-action moments, which are heavily aided by the music and cinematography. When this is the case, even the slow parts feel escalated.The entire cast gives great performances, but I need to single out Anya Taylor-Joy. I want her cast in every movie. She has the acting talent as well as a screen presence and charisma that has you glued to every scene she's in. I've liked her in everything I've seen of hers, which already includes so many great movies like Split/Glass, Last Night in Soho, and Morgan. We're witnessing the birth of a star. It's possible I'm a bit biased due to her being one of the most beautiful women on the planet.I highly recommend The Northman. If any cinemas in your area are playing it on a premium screen, it's definitely worth it. Unfortunately IMAX is still showing Fantastic Beasts. (1 viewing, opening Thursday EMAX 4/21/2022)
8 The NorthmanI thought it was brilliantThis movie is not for everyone due to the levels of violence and gore.It was an incredible mix of different elements that added up to an understanding of brutal Viking culture and how they may have lived. The different themes were fate, revenge, mythology and destiny.The mythological elements were handled with great panache, with highly stylised quasi dream sequences driving the chapters this could have been a disaster but here it worked in spades.There wasn't a lot of script it was all action and Alexander Skarsgård was perfectly cast as the cast out revenge driven son, in fact the whole movie was stuffed with stars. All I can say Nicole Kidman is wow, who'd have thunk it! The jury is still out on Claes Bang, seemed wooden and Anna Taylor-Joy, had the look, but others may be more kind!It was long at 2 hours and 16 mins, and divided into chapters in a largely linear story. It was very original and any comparison would be crass but the nearest would be The Vikings with Kirk and Tony.I did laugh out loud as some spots, I wasn't meant to, but it was more shock admiration and absurdity than comedic.The director really got some stellar performances from everyone it was masterful in letting a talented group of actors let rip at their craft.The vision, direction, cinematography and finished product is an 8 outta 10, very original and deeply memorable, I am deducting a couple of marks, firstly I sensed some scene were inserted for shock value and were bordering on gratuitous, the romantic elements were just not well done.
9 Many are fed up with seeing the Viking age depicted with so much brown leather, tattooed heads, woke casting and punk rock haircuts. So when Robert Eggers, a director whose previous two films each dealt with pagan mythology and folklore in a nuanced and thought provoking way, announced that his third film would be about Vikings, I wasn't the only one who dared to get his hopes up.The Northman is indeed consistent with Eggers' last film The Lighthouse, which delves into mythology as a means to explore the dark caverns of the human psyche. Yet unlike any his previous films, it contains impressively choreographed, high octane, action sequences which will appeal to an entirely different audience.In a nod to the first ever story recorded in Western literature, the Odyssey, the Northman also begins with a plot summary in the form of a pagan invocation. While the immortal lines in Ancient Greek invoke the Muse, likely the goddess Calliope, the husky narration of a character later revealed to be a priest of Odin, invokes that god and then reveals exactly what is going to happen with merciless disregard for spoiler-sensitive surprise-enjoyers. This introduction is also highly reminiscent of the opening of Conan the Barbarian which presents the film as a story told by a wizened old yarn spinner, much like this Odinic priest. Right from the get-go, the very pagan theme of fate inexorably leading our protagonist to his end is introduced, and we know what must occur before we finish our popcorn.Spoilers should not concern anyone who knows the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet since this plot borrows from the same source Shakespeare referred to; the medieval Danish tale of Amleth recorded in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus. Amleth was previously adapted for the screen in Prince of Jutland (1994), starring a young Christian Bale as 'Amled'. Eggers has replaced Denmark with the more dramatic landscape of Iceland, and England with the easternmost colony of the Viking world in Ukraine. But Eggers' Amleth does not feign madness like Hamlet, rather he descends into a very real divine madness after being initiated as a wolf of Odin.This transformation is depicted in two scenes showing separate Odinic initiation rituals. The first is early in the film, during Amleth's childhood, when his father King Aurvandil War-Raven initiates his son into manhood with the help of the court jester, Heimir. This 'fool' character is not in the original story but his inclusion was a stroke of real genius on Eggers' part. Heimir is a clear nod to Shakespeare's Yorick, the court jester Hamlet remembered so fondly from his childhood, but who appears in the play only in the form of a disembodied skull. The name Amleth itself, in its Icelandic form Amlóði, had come to mean a fool or jester in medieval Iceland, but it is thought to have originated from a term using the suffix óðr, a word cognate with Odin which refers to the divine madness or frenzy with which that god was associated. Since Amleth's feigned stupidity is replaced by Odinic frenzy in this plot, his feigned stupidity is instead personified as a character who Defoe skilfully portrays in a manner at turns hilarious and terrifying. But Heimir is also a deeply Odinic figure who introduces the young Amleth to the mysteries of the Odin cult in a visually captivating scene which reimagines the world tree of Norse mythology as a family tree which connects all the royal lineages to the god Odin. While this interpretation of the world tree would be alien to Viking pagans, they certainly did believe that kings were descended from Odin and this visual device also serves to illustrate an unforeseen plot twist at the end of the film. During the first initiation, young Amleth not only "becomes" a wolf of Odin, but is also advised by the fool in regards to the mystery of women which he says is connected to the Norns; semi-divine female entities who weave the fates of gods and men. Some Viking-age women practised a kind of shamanic, divinatory magic relating to the threads of fate which was called seiðr - a word which originally referred to a kind of thread like those used in spinning. Odin himself had to learn this magic from a goddess. The theme of the threads of fate is frequently invoked throughout the film with shots of spinning whorls and woollen threads as well as a Norn-like witch played by Icelandic popstar Björk. While Shakespeare's Hamlet agonises over the question of his own being and is thereby delayed from the righteous action of vengeance, Eggers' Amleth remains almost constantly focused on his vendetta, and when he tries to turn from this path, the threads of fate pull him back to his inevitable end.The second Odinic initiation scene occurs when Amleth has become a man with enormous trapezius muscles (row-maxing will do that), employed as a slaver in the kingdom of the Rus in Ukraine. He and a group of men all wearing the skins of wolves are led by a horned priest in a shamanistic ritual which culminates in them howling and snarling like wolves. The priest wears a headdress with horns which terminate in bird heads and this motif is recorded on dozens of artefacts from Anglo-Saxon England and Scandinavia all of which are thought to pertain to a cult of Odin, with the birds representing that god's two ravens. Several depictions also show the horned man dancing with spears and one such depiction from Sweden shows the dancer next to a man in a wolf skin. Thus the priest in this scene struts rhythmically around a ritual fire brandishing two spears in one hand.This is followed by a testosteronous, adrenaline pumping sequence where the wolf men raid a Slavic town for slaves. The town's defenders launch a spear at Amleth who catches it in mid air and returns it in one impressively fluid movement. This seemingly impossible manoeuvre is taken directly from the medieval Icelandic story of Njáls in which the Viking hero Gunnar catches a spear and throws it straight back into his enemy. So even the action choreography has benefited from consulting historical sources!After the raid Amleth receives advice from the witch Björk who sets him back on his fated path of revenge, stowing away on a slave shipment to Iceland. This part was rather silly, since Russian slaves are unlikely to have been sent further west than Sweden (Icelanders were able to acquire slaves more locally from Scotland and Ireland). Presumably historical accuracy was set aside here because Eggers wanted the love interest, Olga, to be some kind of Slavic pagan witch who could be integrated into the dream-like sequences pertaining to fate and the Norns. Couldn't she have been a Celtic witch?Next Olga and Amleth live as slaves on a remote Icelandic farm owned by his uncle and Mother who don't recognise him. This part of the film bears rather a close resemblance to 'When the Raven Flies' (1984), an Icelandic film about an Irish slave who seeks revenge on the Vikings who murdered his parents. There is then an innovative and enigmatic sequence in which Amleth is led by a fox to a cave in which he finds a priest of Odin. The priest, like Shakespeare's gravedigger in Hamlet, shows Amleth the disembodied head of the court jester he loved so well as a boy. But this is not merely a skull like Yorick's, rather the priest has preserved the head with magic, just as Odin preserved the severed head of Mimir so that it could recite to him the esoteric wisdom of Hell. Now we leave Elizabethan courts, descending into the misty realm of telluric pagan esotericism. We hear Defoe's voice speak from beyond the grave instructing Amleth to enter a barrow at night to retrieve a legendary sword with which he shall avenge his father. Heimir, like Mimir, serves as a prophet in death, but in fact he had been a prophet even in life too, for at the start of the film he makes lewd insinuations about Amleth's Mother the Queen. A grave warning disguised as bawdy humour.We never see the lips of the head move, and as with all the supernatural sequences in the film, Eggers leaves open the possibility that these phenomena are only depictions of what the characters imagine or dream they are seeing. In the following scene when Amleth, beneath the light of the full moon, breaks into the barro, we see again how faithfully the film adheres to historical accuracy, since the corpse of the great man in the barrow can be dated to the pre-Viking Vendel era based on his weapons and armour. There are many stories of men retrieving ancient weapons from barrows such as the poem Hervararkviða in which a woman climbs into her father's barrow to retrieve a sword called Tyrfing. The corpse Amleth encounters is sat upright on a throne, which in Norse lore is a sure sign that he will come back to life as a zombie which the Vikings called a draugr. Sure enough an intense fight scene between Amleth and the draugr ensues, ending with Amleth shoving its decapitated head between its buttocks - this too is attested in the sources. But then it cuts back to Amleth standing before the seated corpse as though nothing had happened. Was it all a dream? Exactly the sort of supernatural ambiguity we should expect from Eggers.The depiction of the Odinic priest wearing a woman's dress and an anachronistic 17th century Christian symbol was unfortunate and based on a strongly contested theory that Odin wore women's clothes as part of divinatory seiðr rituals. These are, however, minor quibbles with an expertly crafted film which is well cast, with actors pulling off some phenomenal performances (Nicole Kidman deserves particular praise for her role as the detestable Queen Gudrún). Eggers is certainly among the greatest filmmakers of his generation and regardless of how well The Northman performs at the box office, I don't need to put on a dress to prophesy that it will be remembered as a cult classic of cinema history.
7 Epic films over Vikings are I think less common than epics about the Roman empire , but they have been always there. An example is "The Vikings" (1958, Richard Fleischer). Although "The Lord of the rings" (2001 - 2003, Peter Jackson) is not strictly Viking, the Tolkien story is undeniably based on Nordic mythology and has given an impetus to the genre.In the films over the Roman empire their civilisation and their military might are equally emphasized most of the time. In Viking films on the other hand the violence dominates. I hoped that a director like Robert Eggers would change that emphasis. In "The Northman" he did so less drastically than I hoped for. Yes there are some scenes with Nordic religious rituals, but the emphasis is still on the action scenes. I am afraid that to learn more about the Viking culture I have to read the book "Children of Ash and Elm" (2020, Neil Price), what I'm definitely planning.After "The Witch" (2015) and "The Lighthouse" (2019), "The Northman" (2022) is the first Eggers film with a big budget. The film remains vintage Eggers, but on the other hand it is clear that, compared to his earlier films, Eggers feeled obliged to make the film commercially more attractive by adding some action scenes. The iconic ending scene makes however very clear that "The Northman" in no way glorifies violence.With vintage Eggers I am not so much reffering to the rituals included but much more to the state of mind of the lead character Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard). In all of his previous films the lead characters had or got a twisted mind. In "The Witch" this is due to a gloomy, stern and depressing religious belief, in "The lighthouse" due to loneliness and in "The Northman" due to all-consuming vengeance. The character of Olga (Anya Taylor Joy) gives Amleth the opportunity to broaden his mind. The opportunity is however not taken.As already mentioned, Alexander Skarsgard plays the lead character prince Amleth. One might think that this character is based in the Shakespearian Hamlet, but in reality it is the other way around. Amleth is a folkloric character from the writings of the 13th century historian Saxo Grammaticus.In one of the most cruel scenes Amleth and his fellow warriors conquer and then burn down a Slavic village. This scene also draws attention to the extent of the area in which the influence of the Vikings was felt. In a recent podcast about Russian history I learned that Kiev (the city is once mentioned in the dialogue of "The Northman") is a city with strong Viking influences while Moscow is more influenced by the Mogul culture of Ghengis Kahn.
5 This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping "The Northman" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is "The Green Knight", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but "The Northman" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold.
7 In the 95h century young Priceling Amleth vows to avenge his treacherously slain father. Being as how he's just a lad, this takes him many years and lot of geography. By the time he locates the target of his vengeance, he is changed from a pretty, effeminate pre-teen to a husky, hairy, scowly, muscular man of few words, and his journey has taken him from somewhere to somewhere different. The somewhere different is Iceland, but there's still lots of grey grass, gray mud, and grey snow. Bloodshed ensues.Well, this is a weird one. In case the main character's name doesn't give it away, it's Hamlet, transposed to a cheerless Nordic/Germanic background. Title screens are in futhorc or something similar, with English translation. Similarly, some dialogue is in (I assume ) an original tongue, although most involves English in a distracting accent.It was well staged, the locations and sets are effective if uninviting, and everyone and everything is extremely dirty and looks very cold. The performances are good, with caveats. Alexander Skarsgard's Amleth is a bit one-note, and his Mum should have been someone a bit lower profile than Nicole Kidman. Anya Taylor-Joy is as magnetic as always. Their are a couple more high-profile names buried under makeup and hair. They could have been anybody.It is very violent, by the way - there is no profanity but, on the other hand, a bit of nudity, a couple of decapitations, some dismemberment, and some violent field sports more than make up for this.
10 Amleth is the main character, but move the last letter and put it first in the name and you will see the contours of the epic costume: a dark tale of a father murder, a killer uncle and the little boy who has witnessed it all and wants revenge. Shakespeare borrowed the plot from the Nordic medieval legend about Amleth to "Hamlet", but Robert Egger's handling of the material in "The Northman" is a far more brutal and more existential experience. A pure bloody masterpiece, brutally breathtaking.
10 The Northman is unlike anything that has been released this year. Anya Taylor Joy killed it once again in her role. The whole cast was spectacular. I left the theater with my jaw hanging it was unbelievable. I thought I was on the set of this movie that's how real this felt. The last time I saw anything this good was last months The Batman.This movie is a must see film for any history buff or really anyone. The fight scenes are some of the best and most brutal that I have ever seen I thought I was going to get sick they were that good. I hope the Oscars remember this movie because this should win some awards.11/10.
8 Relying on a visible work of research and being very faithful to the customs and history of a people, The Northman demonstrates that Eggers is still in great shape.It is a work that will win with more than one viewing, betting on a strong construction of characters and demanding commitment from those who watch. That effort is rewarded with an epic revenge story, excellent performances, unexpected scenes, lots of violence and beautiful cinematography.Full review (in PT): Critica - The Northman.
9 The Northman is a match made in Heaven that has ventured through Hel and Niflheim to reach us. 'Tis a masterwork of grit and violence that is also contemplative and beautiful; a surely crowd-pleasing action film that can also be unmistakably discerned as the work of modern genius Robert Eggers.In the film, Eggers captures the beauty and brutality of Nordic folklore -- from the snarling intensity of Alexander Skarsgård to the ethereal mysticism of Björk as The Seeress (plus a far better usage of Iceland as a shooting location than last year's Lamb). What might turn some people off, even those at my local theater who will watch anything with a half-naked Skarsgård family member in it, is the story, which is "Hamlet all over again" to anyone who doesn't know just where Shakespeare got the idea for his most mimicked play.When a movie is based on a tale that has inspired countless others, causing many a newbie to mislabel the film "unoriginal", I usually bring up the John Carter Effect, which I might now need to rename "the Amleth effect", as the Scandinavian legends of Prince Amleth predate the tales of Hamlet and The Lion King more so than the source material of John Carter predates Attack of the Clones, Total Recall, et al. Having said that, I understand if you find the plot itself a touch predictable. When King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) greets another character (Claes Bang) as "brother", we all know who is killing whom a few scenes ahead.War-Raven's son, of course, survives and grows up into a bloodthirsty Alexander Skarsgård, now a Viking warrior who eventually disguises himself as a slave in order to be shipped back to his uncle to exact revenge and save his mother Queen Gudrún (a phenomenal Nicole Kidman). Driven by a sense of loyalty to his blood, even when a beautiful Slavic slave named Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to steer him toward a new life, he sticks to what he feels is his duty -- his destiny -- but makes a discovery that challenges everything. I dare not say too much.The cast is utterly sublime and I'm still yet to mention everyone; there's Willem Dafoe having the time of his life as "he-witch" Heimir the Fool, Gustav Lindh as Amleth's sniveling half-brother, two separate actors who are both named Ian Whyte, plus such major Icelandic names as theater actor Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson, strongman Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, and the aforementioned Björk. This constitutes her first "real" acting role since Dancer in the Dark (2000) -- and while I am aware of her appearance in one of Matthew Barney's works, I'm not generous enough to call anything he's made a "real" movie.My companion and I agreed that this was simultaneously this year's Dune and The Green Knight -- a thunderous "thinking man's blockbuster" on one hand and arthouse Fantasy on the other. Both of those works supplied some of the most striking visuals and music of that year, which rings true of The Northman as well.I'm sure many critics dismissed the film as some sort of male power fantasy (albeit one that's distinctly the work of Eggers and so supplies effective visuals and strong acting). However, the movie has a somewhat subversive take on this story; a point to be made about those beastly impulses all "true" men are supposed to pursue and how they might be easily manipulated into doing so by the right appeals and powerwords (ideas of honor, legacy, duty, fate, and so on and so forth). This, along with the artful visuals, is what critics mean when they say that this is an action blockbuster as done by an actually smart filmmaker: it's not as straightforward as you might believe from a surface look.That being said, it can certainly be enjoyed as a gruff and violent testosterone-fest, but that still doesn't mean it's just for the dudes. First of all, anyone can appreciate this caliber of bombastic-yet-immaculately-coordinated filmmaking and this tier of effective imagery (this is among the best-choreographed combat you will see in recent cinema, and a few of the more brutal sequences seem directly inspired by 1985's Come and See).More importantly, when Skarsgård was doing his most intense gruntings and snarlings, I'm pretty sure the lady on the row behind me started moaning.
9 This is a movie that I've been excited about. It feels like I heard about this movie a couple years ago and I'm assuming due to COVID, it got pushed back. Knowing that Robert Eggers as doing a new movie that was featuring Vikings and revenge, you had me in. The more that I heard about the cast, it piqued my interest even more. Now I got to see this early thanks to Fright Club Podcast, as they had a showing through the Focus group.We start this movie with Amleth (Oscar Novak) as a boy. He greets his father who is back from war. His father is King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) who is known as War-Raven. Amleth's mother is Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). His world is turned upside when his father is murdered and Amleth flees. Years later, he grows up in the land of Rus, having joined another group of Vikings. Amleth is now a fierce berserker. His oath to avenge his father and rescue his mother never leaving his mind. He then sets out to do so. In the process, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and falls in love with her. It makes him question what to do.What I will say is that Eggers has done it again. I've seen all his movies in the theater. This is the one that needs to be seen there for sure. His care with making it feel like we're in the past is great. From the language to the look and the outfits, it is amazing. I like that we're given runes they'd use, the spelling of the things and just the care that was taken has it on point. We get a simple story, but the depths that Amleth goes to get his revenge is amazing. There is also a great cast which helps. I like the music that we get to help build the atmosphere. My experience here was worth seeing it early.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.
9 The Northman is a gritty, visceral, other worldly, unrelenting masterpiece.The camera work is incredible, the acting is flawless, the music a perfect strong booming accompaniment and the whole film has an incredibly unique feel to it.This is in my opinion, the best depiction of Vikings and Norse Gods I have ever seen. Whilst I was hoping for one giant battle spectacle, it really isn't that sort of film, and I am now somewhat glad it didn't follow the stereotypical huge blockbuster battles nor have that Hollywood feel.This is a loose adaptation of the 13th century tale Amleth, which eventually inspired William Shakespeares Hamlet.If you think yourself a film buff - you 100% need to see this movie. I can appreciate the general viewer may find this too intense, but more fool them. This is Robert Zeggers best work so far.
8 Greetings again from the darkness. After two incredible arthouse films that earned the label "visionary filmmaker" for Robert Eggers, some would not have been surprised to find him cashing in on a huge payday for the next colossal superhero movie. But for those of us who adore and respect him for THE WITCH (2015) and THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019), we knew Mr. Eggers was not the comic book type. Instead, he secured a hefty budget (still less than $100 million) and with his co-writer, Icelandic author Sjon (writer of last year's mesmerizing LAMB), created the most epic Viking movie to date ... while firmly maintaining his artsy stylings.Every now and then a movie comes along and I must accept that my words will fall short; that I won't be able to do justice to what I've experienced on screen. This is certainly one of those times. Based on the same Scandinavian folk tale that inspired Shakespeare to pen "Hamlet", this Eggers film is not just meticulously researched, it also pulls us right in so that we slosh through the mud and muck. We shiver from the cold. We feel the wind and the brutality of the violence. We live the harsh elements of Viking life.The film opens in the year 895 AD as young Prince Amleth welcomes home his battle-weary father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Not long after jester Heimer the Fool (Willem Dafoe) jokes about the Queen and the King's brother, the boy witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang, the excellent "Dracula" TV mini-series, 2020) strike dead the king. Amleth escapes, pledging to avenge his father's murder and the kidnapping of his mother, Queen Gudrun (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman). Flash forward twenty years and Amleth has become a behemoth of a man played by Alexander Skarsgard (Eric Northman in "True Blood"), who lives, fights, and kills alongside violent 10th century Vikings. Amleth is a hulking beast unmatched in battle, yet one who never unnecessarily harms women or children.His revenge plan leads him to the farming village where his mother and Uncle Fjolnir now live as wife and husband, an arrangement Amleth is certain she adheres to for her own safety and that of her new son. Bjork, in her first big screen role since DANCER IN THE DARK (2000), appears as the seeress who knows Amleth's destiny. It's here where Amleth meets Olga "of the Birch Forest" (Anya Taylor-Joy) and reveals his plan to her. Olga describes her supernatural abilities as breaking men's minds in contrast to his breaking their bones. The two are quite the match.Eggers stages a stunning final showdown with a naked sword fight atop a burning volcano to ensure we aren't subjected to an ending that falls short. The visceral savagery on the screen is somehow both brutal and beautiful. This is epic cinematic brilliance from Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who treat us to numerous long takes in harsh weather and discomforting action. This is 136 minutes featuring some of cinemas best faces, while also proving that visionary is simply not a strong enough word to describe director Robert Eggers.Opening in theaters on April 22, 2022.
10 This is a masterpiece! Photography, storytelling, scenery, motives, actors, everything!One of the best films I watched in recent years. Recommend 10/10.
6 No surprise that the visuals were breathtaking, some beautiful shots and immersive cinematography. However, there was no depth to the plot. Some lovely character moments.
7 Though the style part was enjoyable on it's own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn't feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I'm not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.
4 Rather slow and boring with a politically oriented plot which throttles itself through its design choices. There's lots of spectacular looking CGI and special effects, but most of the action was in dark scenes which made it hard to see what was going on and for all the magic in the film, it had none of the awe or amazement of the Harry Potter films. Some funny moments and the acting and music was ok, but the secrets were underwhelming and although the production value was high, the entertainment level was not.
6 In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.Becoming less and less about the titular beasts that started this Eddie Redmayne lead adventure all the way back in 2016 and more about trying to draw in extra audience engagement and enthusiasm by bringing back known staples such as Hogwarts and a much more prevalent Albus Dumbledore into this latest outing, you can see the battle raging between Fantastic Beasts trying to figure out exactly what it is and who its for and its a battle that isn't won clearly by the conclusion of this third outing, making it a sometimes frustratingly cold experience that still manages to entertain to decent degree.Without a clear identity or even a character we can truly call our own, with Redmayne's Newt Scamander getting to do his awkward shtick here once more but feeling more like a bystander to whats going on around him, with new addition Mads Mikkelsen's Grindelwald growing in power and his old acquaintance Dumbledore trying to assemble a crack team to help thwart his plans, Fantastic Beasts is hamstrung by its inability to focus its attention into a specific story arc or character journey, with its drab grey and gloomy sets, dark themes and heavy topics feeling rather unmagical for a film that potentially could've finally shed the shackles of past expectations to really let fly with some inventiveness and spark.There are snippets of such things here, a prison escape and some brief moments spent back in the halls of Hogwarts but for a majority of the films two hour plus runtime there's not a whole lot of memorable moments delivered in Yates film, which is by no means offensively bad or incoherent like much of Crimes of Grindelwald was but it still makes you wish someone could take hold of this property and turn it into the possibly great series it could be, something that is unlikely now with two films left to come.While not inspiring much jaw-dropping or magical chills, there's still an undeniable cinematic goodness to Rowling's magic filled universe and there is a feeling here that with Dumbledore building his ragtag group of foot soldiers and with Mikkelsen giving Grindelwald a significant amount of menace and unnerving energy, there's hope yet still that the final chapters of Rowling's mid-tier and seemingly unloved property can still work to a level that will ensure we walk away from the Fantastic Beasts series indifferent in ways but not upset at what's been done to our beloved world of wizards, witches and muggles (and the odd beast or two).Final Say -Still far removed from even the lesser of the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a small step back in the right direction following the crimes of the last entry and while its still not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination, its a passable diversion of anyone with a passing interest in the Harry Potter cannon.3 crab walks out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
2 Where to begin with this agonising experience? Its a 2 hour 20 minute film that feels like its twice that length. I think the writers must have been paid per character they introduce, because this film has so many characters they sink the ship that this franchise is.Nothing happens for so long. No one is interesting. We don't care about anything. The saving grace of this film is that the acting across the board is great, but great acting cannot save awful writing.The two good characters are Dumbledore and Newt. Jude Law is great as Dumbledore and, as the title suggests, we learn things about him. Newt is a fun plucky character. I feel bad his Fantastic Beasts series was taken over by this dour slog simulator.The action is messy. There's no stakes to the action because you don't care about anyone. The film jumps from place to place to thing to thing and nothing is interesting. Why do I care about any of these people (apart from my boy Newt).Someone needs to lose the writers and directors for the sequels because all I can say about this series is that its a colossal waste of time.
6 Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast "universe" a succes?Well, the main storyline was okey but the rest of it was kinda unimportant and not that interesting..
Also like i had with the previous two installments was the lack of intensity and emotions in the action scenes.And after 3 completed movie i still can't find my connection with most of the characters especially the main one's.The "recasting" of Johnny Depp was a huge mistake for the development of Grindelwald's character!One of the outstanding parts were the CGi and special effects so enjoyable and well created.Also the Harry Potter references were nice, lovely and not overdone
It's a overall good movie but not one to rewatch weekly like the other two, it's pretty predictable with more forgettable moments than remembered once's.I really wanted to like it more but it just didn't really worked out for me...
5 A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.Instead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.Plus the faceless army of Grindelwald's followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn't even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.The whole "we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world"-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn't any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer.
4 Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of DumbledoreThis really was quite dull, how far has this franchise fallen, from funny tasting toffees and "oculus repairum" spells to repair broken specs, to this dreary, tedious and miserable movie. There was no evidence whatsoever of the creative brilliance of JK Rowling, this was created by a teen committee at the United Woke Nations.It was broadly about an evil man wanting to become PM of the magic world (he just wasn't very evil) and quite frankly who cares. The rest was tying up loose ends in the most predictable of fashions.It was over CGI'd, the music unimaginative, the plot predictable, just nothing new to be found here.At best this is a weak 4 outta 10, meaning best forgotten about using that obliviate spell!
2 I loved the first two films in the "Beasts" franchise - original, well paced, and with interesting story lines.However, this third installment is slow, confused, with too many plot lines and just plods to a fairly predictable conclusion in half an hour more than it needs to be.This film had significant script problems, and it shows. The originator of the franchise has obviously run out of ideas, and the studio lack the courage to bring someone else in that can take the franchise and keep the quality up.It's said that authors should never adapt their own work, and although this is an original story, rather than from a book. The same reasons are true. The author gets too attached to irrelevant story lines and character arcs, whilst fresh eyes can trim the fat and produce a more coherent work. Added to this is the heavy handed allegory of the rise of European socialism in Germany in the 20s and 30s driven by Rowling's somewhat dubious politics, and it's a recipe for nearly two and a half hours of turgid self-indulgence.It is said that if you love something, set it free. Well, Rowling obviously hates this franchise. She should set it free and let a professional take over.
6 The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.Writing: 5/10

1 Firing Johnny Depp was a huge and costly mistake. I was actually excited to finally get into the Fantastic Beasts franchise having always been a Harry Potter fan but after learning how little integrity Warner Brothers has I have lost all interest.
8 Even though it still has a reasonably messy narrative, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a significant improvement over it's disappointing predecessor that actually remembers to be fun and emotionally satisfying with genuinely magical moments.Eddie Redmayne still has the adorably awkward charm and likeability that make him a consistently great lead. Mads Mikkelsen is definitely the best Grindelwald with a more subtle and restrained evil presence.Jude Law is once again an incredible Dumbledore and Dan Fogler is still a really funny scene stealer. Jessica Williams is an amazing new addition with endless charisma and is instantly likeable.David Yates' direction is really good despite having done so many already, still delivering inventive set pieces and great fights. The CG is mostly impressive if a little overused. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent, adding to the overall atmosphere with effective callbacks and heartwarming whimsy.
5 We've been waiting for this movie for so long and we are so very disappointed with the non-original, empty story line. Many key topics were squeezed into couple of sentences and instead of building a proper story line, it was filled with some magic tricks.Although in general I like Mads Mikkelsen, I didn't think he was a good fit for the role. Depp played a more specific and rememberable character, whereas Mads Mikkelsen was just a simple emotionless 'bad guy' character which I found to be very one-dimentional.All and all, I don't think we will be watching the next movie in the cinema.
6 Storyline wasn't that interesting. Magic wand again? Another Harry Potter type of movie? Fighting scene not intense at all. Kind of slow pace, hard to get into it. Need more highlight in the scene.
1 I probably managed to stay awake for less than half of this film, if you add up the bits that I endured. Perhaps that means I don't have the right to judge it. But to my mind it accurately reflects the fare on offer. A lot of the dialogue was inaudible. Nothing much happened for long periods. When action does kick in it can be visually stirring, but with so little investment in the characters and their predicament it was not exciting.As I have never been keen on Harry Potter, fans of the franchise may feel they should take these comments with a pinch of salt. But my wife, who loved Harry Potter and dragged me to a number of the films, yawned her way through this and pronounced it poor.
1 Can we stop with the agenda? For crying out loud it's just becoming too much. They basically messed up the whole movie for nothing. It was boring, weird and the plot was absolutely horrific.
9 My Review - Fantastic Beasts :
The Secrets of Dumbledore
My Rating 9/10In my review of the last Fantastic Beasts : The Crimes of Grindelwald which I rated 6/10 I said after I wouldn't see this third instalment after being underwhelmed by the previous Fantastic Beast films but I'm so glad I relented hoping 3rd time lucky because I love the Harry Potter characters and the magic wizardry and can only ask
Wow! What happened ? Someone has visited Olivander's wand shop since The Crimes of Grindelwald and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.My theory is that the magic wand used in this 3rd Instalment of Fantastic Beasts belongs to Steve Kloves one of the original screenwriters of the Harry Potter franchise movies Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 & 2 .Steve Kloves was bought back to assist J. K. Rowling after the luke warm reception the first 2 Fantastic Beasts movie received it's been ten years since JK Rowling and Steve Klove's last collaboration together and the magic is back.Not all original novelists make great screenplay writers and I suspect J K Rowling is one of them.I read an interesting article that basically explains that creative control aside, screenwriting holds financial appeal for authors. Rights to a novel are pretty cheap optioning will often earn writers less than their initial book advance-but a screenwriting assignment can pay well into six figures however novels can luxuriate in internal moments of indecision and longing. Movies keep chugging along at 24 frames per second."
Fantastic Beasts :The Secrets of Dumbledore has the same Director David Yates as the 2 previous Fantastic Beasts films he also directed 4 of the Harry Potter movies and its great to see the spirit of those films back at last.In my opinion the story this time instead of resembling a Marvel Studios action movie returns to the Spirit of Hogwart's Wizard World with more insight into character development and a much less confusing story with some touching and comedic moments, especially the sideways crab dance that Newt and brother Theseus (Callum Turner) have to perform to escape from the deadly cave creatures.Jude Law is superb as the younger Professor Albus Dumbledore who knows the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald ( Mads Mikkelsen ) is moving to seize control of the wizarding world.I even warmed to Eddie Redmayne this time as Magiczoologist Newt Scamander who Albus Dumbledore entrusts to lead an intrepid team of wizards, witches and one brave Muggle baker Jacob Kowalski ( Dan Fogler) on a dangerous mission, where they encounter old and new beasts and clash with Grindelwald's growing legion of followers.Perhaps I'm reading too much into the story but for me there's comparisons to our troubled muggle world today and the evil influences affecting us.Is there an alternate Wizard or supernatural universe that we're unaware of that is plotting to destroy life as we know it?I particularly enjoyed Jessica Williams as the charismatic witch Eulailie Lally Hicks her increased role in this instalment adds charm and wit to the much improved script.Also Victoria Yeats is delightful as Bunty Broadacre protector of the wonderful qilin a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future . Alison Sudol returns as Queenie Goldstein the delightful and half muggle half witch romantic interest of Muggle baker Jacob Kowalski.Great visual effects and set designs by Anna Pinnock with costumes by Colleen Atwood who dresses Jude Law with sartorial elegance all add to a top review from me . I certainly never thought I'd be saying that I will certainly look forward to the next Fantastic Beasts movie after Crimes of Grindelwald but I've learnt it's wise never to say never.Take a look at the timeline to see how the events of Fantastic Beasts connect to Harry Potter..........1881: Albus Dumbledore is born to Percival and Kendra Dumbledore in the village of Mould-on-the-Wold.1883: Albus' brother, Aberforth Dumbledore, is born.1885: Albus' sister, Ariana Dumbledore, is born.1891: Ariana is attacked by three Muggle boys. Percival seeks revenge for his daughter's assault and is imprisoned in Azkaban for it.September 1892-June 1899: Albus attends Hogwarts.1899: Kendra is accidentally killed by Ariana, forcing Albus to return home to care for his sister. Grindelwald arrives in Godric's Hollow after being expelled from Durmstrang Institute and befriends Albus. Ariana is accidentally killed during a three-way duel between Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald, prompting Grindelwald to flee.1900-1926: At some point in this time period, Grindelwald steals the Elder Wand-one of the three Deathly Hallows-from wandmaker Gregorovitch.~1908: Credence Barebone, a.k.a. Aurelius Dumbledore, is born.December 1926: Newt Scamander arrives in America. Tom Riddle Jr.-who later becomes Lord Voldemort-is born in London.1927: Newt travels to Paris to find Credence on Albus' orders. Credence flees with Grindelwald to Nurmengard where he learns that he is Albus' long-lost brother Aurelius. Newt publishes Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.1938: Voldemort begins attending Hogwarts.1943: Voldemort creates his first horcrux.1945: Voldemort leaves Hogwarts and disappears. Albus defeats Grindelwald in a duel, winning control of the Elder Wand and ending the Global Wizarding War. Grindelwald is sentenced to life in Nurmengard prison.1956: Albus is appointed headmaster of Hogwarts.1970: The First Wizarding War begins.July 1980: Harry Potter is born in Godric's Hollow.October 1981: Voldemort's soul is ripped from his body when he attempts to kill baby Harry, ending the First Wizarding War.September 1991: Harry begins attending Hogwarts.June 1995: Voldemort regains his physical body and the Second Wizarding War begins.June 1997: Severus Snape kills Albus.March 1998: Voldemort kills Grindelwald in Nurmengard in an attempt to gain control of the Elder Wand.May 1998: Harry defeats Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts, ending the Second Wizarding War.
2 Boring, broken plot, bad characters, terrible logic. I don't even know why Warner allowed the movie to be shown. I'd rather sleep at home for two hours than waste my time in cinema.
8 Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore: Mads Mikkelsen takes over as Grindelwald and is very good indeed in the part, at times he's seemingly channeling Hannibal. There is a poignant scene as the film opens though where he meets Dumbledore (Jude Law) over a cup of tea and they philosophise over their lost love but there is no rapprochement. Some great CGI but the action is important as Grindelwald challenges for the position of Supreme Mugwump, Much of the action takes place in a Germany where Grindelwald has subverted it's Ministry of Magic and there are allegories with Nazi Germany as his supporters rally and his Gestapo like goons combat Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his team. A prison rescue sequence has plenty of wonderful creatures and monsters but outstays it's welcome. Still, this film is an improvement on The Crimes of Grindelwald even if it would have benefited from a 15 minute cut in it's running time. Directed by David Yates, written by J. K. Rowling and Steve Kloves. 8/10.
6 As a real Potterhead, I watched Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore Premiere in the theatre. After the movie got postponed twice my expectations got higher and I was definitely optimistic about this one. It dissapointed me again. The longest part of the movie is totally unnecessary and boring, filling our heads with some information in a really slow way. The last part of the movie contains few great battles and Harry Potter backstory information so the movie is definitely watchable especially for the Harry Potter fans, but generally the plot barely exists and the whole movie is only a bridge to the new, upcoming one. Just like the last part, The Crimes of Grindelwald, this one contains great visuals and fighting sequences, but awful pacing and a boring plot.
2 The movie is really slow, eats ur mind like anything🤦. It deserved a strong narrative and storyline about "The Dumbledore of Hogwarts" but completely thumbs down👎. Hope to see something good like old HP days in the near future. This is really pathetic. Not a single character is entertaining.
2 I don't understand what the idea of this movie was. It has a lot of nonsense fit together into a movie that doesn't matter at all. The whole idea of the movie makes no sense.It's such a missed opportunity. I was really sad to see what they did.The best scenes in the movie have been like 5 minutes all together in Hogwarts when it was not about the plot.
3 The first couple of Fantastic Beasts movies were MUCH better than this although nothing compared to the original Harry Potter series of course. Plot holes galore, boring characters and disservice to the primary FB cast who didn't seem to be as enthusiastic in their roles as they once were. This of course includes the legendary Johnny Depp whom was sorely missed in this film. Mad's performance as Grindelwald was just like any plain and ordinary 'bad guy' with the emotional range of a teaspoon as Hermione once famously said. My favourite parts were when the original 'Harry Potter' themes played although Hogwarts was an utter husk to how it was in the Potter franchise...
This is the first and only 'Potterverse' film that was lacklustre and disappointing imo. Hopefully the next films will step up their game because they can only use 'the pandemic' as an excuse for so much these days. A lot of shows & movies suck lately. Even ones that used to be great (Marvel, The Walking Dead etc.)
5 As a Harry Potter fan I am very disappointed. Since it was called "The Secrets of Dumbledore" i I was expecting a lot more in depth exploration of the character and the history with Grindelwald etc. But nothing particularly interesting or that we didn't already know was revealed. The movie is filled with so much action and sub-plots that kids would maybe enjoy but felt very unnecessary. The reasoning behind all the drama felt a bit ridiculous and ultimately degrading to the source material, I could not take the plot seriously.This is not how I imagine the history of these Harry Potter characters unravelling and I doubt many fans find it plausible or likeable. It's hard to believe JK Rowling had much creative input on this film, as I don't think she would ever write something like this, even though she co-wrote and produced it. I feel like the second movie was bad so this one was just trying to work with the mess of a story it was left with.This movie is not completely unenjoyable though, If I did not care as much about taking the plot seriously and staying truthful to the Harry Potter universe, i'd have liked it more. Some of it was quite funny and there was some cool editing and cinematography, as well as the casting being pretty good and decent acting.
1 Just when I thought it couldn't get any more insulting than The Crimes of Grindelwald - Yates & Rowling outdid themselves in spectacular fashion.What an atrocious, insulting, messy, inconsistent, awkward jumble of a film.Laughable plotlines, non-sensical world and lore building, convenience is at an all time high - and don't get me started on the clear and present merchandising attempts through washed out fan service.Any Harry Potter fan will agree with me when I say that this cash grab of a series needs to die.Annoyingly - it's SO bad that I can't wait to see what bull they try and get away with in the next one.
9 Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!
28 March 2022 It's very rare that I give a movie a full score. This is because when I look at my list later, I want full score movies to really mean something. "Everything Everywhere All at Once" was such a masterpiece, being both experimental yet grounded, absurdist yet profound. Everything about this film was amazing. The story. The performances. Even the metatextual casting of Michelle Yeoh is fascinating, since Michelle Yeoh is an actress that really has lived a million lives in her own multiverse. This film absolutely floored me.
10 Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.
9 It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.
9 Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.
10 Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was "a woman tries to do her taxes," and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.Believe the hype.Go in knowing as little as possible.See this movie.
9 Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.
9 This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).
10 If you get weirded out just stay through til the end. It's worth it I promise. Thanks everyone who helped this movie be made. In a time when there's so many remakes and more of the same this is a wonderful original movie. Enjoy it.
10 This might seem like a weird thing to start off with but, the editing in this movie was really well done. For a movie like this, the editing needs to be clean in order to properly follow the story and the editing team succeeded in this task. The use of parallel editing in this movie was cleverly done and worked flawlessly with the story especially when a match cut was also used. The story for this movie as well is a unique one that makes you think one thing but then becomes something else. The main story for this movie just seems like any other action/sci-fi movie with there being a chosen one who's the only one that can save the universe but underneath that is a deeper story. The deeper story is really what hooks the audience for this wild and wacky ride of a movie as it's one everybody can relate to. What I really liked about this story though was how it easily mashed everything together from the comedy to the more serious moments and the action scenes. Another thing about the writing for this movie is how something will be mentioned and just seem like a throwaway thing but then come back in some way. This is a testament to the writers and directors of this movie Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. This movie is a weird and wacky ride and the directing duo understood that and dived headfirst into it which is what makes this movie a unique and memorable one. What also helps in that department is the acting in this movie and man did everybody deliver for this movie. Everybody in this movie had to juggle between being serious and comedic and nailed it. Michelle Yeoh was the stand-out performance for me and I just want to know how she was able to stay in character during some of the scenes in this movie. The final thing I want to talk about with this movie is the lighting in this movie and how well it was used. The lighting in this movie, along with the screen ratio, helps the audience figure out which universe it is. In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a wild and wacky ride that has a meaningful message along with it that you need to see.
8 Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as "Daniels", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the "normal" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as "Big Nose", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.
9 If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.
10 Leaving the movie theatre, I can barely comprehend the thoughts swirling around in my head right now. From the intriguing trailer, you wouldn't even begin to fathom the existential depths this movie submerges you under. Only to bring you back to the surface gasping for air just when things are at their bleakest. The directorial choices are the sign of geniuses at work, the acting and cinematography and editing really show that mastery plus effort leaves the roof smashed off the place Everything Everywhere All At Once is perfection in all these regards.You know it's special when you leave the movie feeling like it was made just for you. Daniels accomplished just that with this work of art coming to me right exactly when I needed it. The themes of family, fulfillment, love, and everything in between hit resoundingly close to home. I'm so glad I got to experience this even if it doesn't win any Oscars which it absolutely ought to. If critics don't carry this little picture on all their best of lists I don't know what to do. The picture itself, Michelle Yeoh in Actress, Stephanie Hsu in Supporting Actress, Ke Huy Quan in Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, Directing, Editing, Costumes, Visual Effects, Score., Sound, Academy please consider Everything Everywhere All At Once. I know it's a challenge given the absurdity of some of the plot beats of the film but when you boil it down it's a very heartwarming and affecting piece of cinema.
10 Non stop action and laughs the whole way through. Everything Everywhere All At Once is the movie that you need to see if you want a great cinematic experience. In my opinion I think this is as good possible better than No Way Home. I loved the acting in this as well.The way that the directors filmed this movie was also genius. The whole concept of the film was brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis was also phenomenal as always. This film was just absolutely stunning to watch and to look at. Easily one of the best films of the year so far.
10 I dont often give a film 10 stars, but this was superb. It was an intense and bizarre ride, with the strange concepts stretching so far out there at times, it was as though they made more sense. It was visually stunning, the costumes were epic, and the balance of humor and emotion was perfect. LOVED IT. No one else was meant for this role other than Michelle Yeoh. She brought the lead to life in the most beautiful, meaningful, perfect way. This whole movie was mind blowing.
10 This is a movie you must experience for yourself to fully grasp exactly what it is. I absolutely loved it, and yet I find myself unable to write a coherent review... because the movie is absolutely crazy, as well as being cinematic perfection. It's one of the greatest films I have ever seen, or rather, experienced! Instead of writing a full review, I feel this movie is best described in points, because I don't want to say too much about anything, I just want this to convince anyone reading this to go out and see it as soon as they can (in theatres with an audience)! It's the most original and creative piece of filmmaking I have witnessed in probably the last 5 years, I just can't believe what the directorial duo Daniels was able to pull off here! So without further ado, here are my thoughts on "Everything Everywhere All At Once":* The film is flawless and true cinematic perfection in my eyes!* An assault on the senses; the visuals and sound design are insane!* Extremely impressive from a technical standpoint.* Editing is a huge standout and was incredibly done, the edit alone took us on a ride! They used match cuts so creatively too!* Cinematography was stunning, I especially loved the creative use of lighting!* Sound design was absolutely crazy, it had so much going on and complimented the visuals perfectly!* Every genre of film in one!* I've never seen anything like it, it's ambitious, crazy, bonkers, insane, creative, hilariously funny, heartfelt, clever, wild, awesome, the best, odd, wacky, touching, chaotic but in a well-written way, stylized, brilliant, and most of all, masterful!* None of this movie should work, and yet due to the Daniels' excellent and clever direction, it somehow does (and yet I still don't know how they were able to pull it off)
* There is no way Multiverse of Madness will be half as crazy as this movie, this is the best multiverse film we will probably ever see
* The writing so cleverly establishes the multiverse rules and keeps it flowing in a way that allows you to feel like you understand what's going on despite how complex it gets. It perfectly guides you through the story without spoon-feeding it to you, making sure the chaotic multiverse makes sense.* Also loved the thematic exploration in the story, and that they didn't let the novelty and entertainment value of the multiverse stuff take away from the story, it just complemented it instead. It's some genius writing, especially when heading into the second half of the film where the emotional/thematic core really starts to open up and shine!* Action is phenomenal and intense. It's some of the best I've seen in the last few years, it's so wild! It's very stylized and impressive, the Daniels know how to direct action so well. They get great coverage that shows off the choreography and every hit, and perfect timing for cuts.* The film is so funny, has some witty dialogue, insane gags that I never saw coming, and some hilarious comedic payoffs - one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, it had both me and the audience howling with laughter!* Michelle Yeoh's performance is astonishing! She's just awesome as the lead; she's so badass in her action scenes, so funny, and yet still gives such an emotional, heartfelt performance
* I also loved Ke Quan as her husband, he was so loveable and had some of the funniest moments. So great to see him acting again, have really missed him since his days in "Indiana Jones" and "The Goonies".* Stephanie Hsu was phenomenal as the daughter, and a huge part of why the 2nd half of the film works as well as it does!* Jamie Lee Curtis had me laughing so hard, she was hilarious here, I've never seen her do anything like this!This film does things you would never expect to see, and I loved it for that! I was enamoured by this film, it's truly a glorious piece of filmmaking. It's one of the coolest films of the last decade and I cannot stop thinking about it. I really want to see it again too, it's so much to take in on first viewing! Daniels truly knocked it out of the park on all levels; as a comedy, action film, familial drama, sci-fi film, something that's thought provoking and emotionally potent, technically impressive and so imaginative. It's just a masterpiece; cinematic perfection. It left me with a feeling of pure joy, I really hope everyone gets a chance to experience this film. You have to see it in a theatre with an audience... it's an insane experience! I just loved it, highly recommend! The film's title really says it all; it's "Everything Everywhere All At Once"!
10 An instant classic, on par with the first Matrix film, EEAAO is a genre-bending masterpiece, equally parts funny, intense and emotional.The basic plot follows Evelyn, a middle aged Chinese woman who develops the ability to share the skills and memories of alternate versions of herself across the multiverse in order to save it.It is FAR deeper than that, and I wish I could go all spoilers, but I saw it early so I'll say this much, it is far more accessible than Swiss Army Man (which is still a great movie in my eyes) and I think many people will find much value in this film.I will say that the audience I watched the movie with was the most excited and active audience I've watched a movie with since Spider-Man No Way Home. A completely original film with no nostalgia bait, getting several cheers, laughs and applauses. Not to mention the few times I got close to crying.10/10 a must see.
9 Everything Everywhere All at Once is stunning. It's a corky spectacle, but remains deeply vulnerable. The narrative follows Evelyn, whose business and personal relationships are failing. Plus, Evelyn is unexpectedly tasked with saving the entire multiverse as her personal life bursts. This story might sound familiar, but it develops into an unparalleled blend of comedy, action, adventure, and drama. Each role is compelling, the conflict is relatable, the arcs are earned, and the plot devices are utilized to their fullest. Furthermore, the entire cast displays a wide range of skills: switching characters, blending tones, and striking beats in a symphony of emotions.Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once is masterfully crafted. Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is marvelous because it fuses so much into a cohesive experience. In other hands, it would be a mess, but Everything Everywhere All at Once works beautifully.Writing: 9/10

10 Just because of how it made me feel. I'm not going to belittle it by trying to encapsulate it here. Such a great movie for so many reasons. Just go see it. Get ready to be intrigued, laugh until you can't laugh anymore, cry because of the beauty of it all, and then question existence on a cosmic level. Just get ready!
8 Michelle Yeoh owns a failing laundromat with her nebbishy husband Ke Huy Quan, who has just served her with divorce papers. They are being audited by IRS agent Jamie Lee Curtis. Her father, James Hong, threw her out when she married, and is now her wheelchair-bound dependent. Her daughter, Stephanie Hsu, has a girlfriend, which she cannot explain to her father. Then, during a terrible session with Miss Curtis, Quan takes off his glasses and in an authoritative voice tells her that only she can save the multiverse; from this reality defined by all the bad choices ever made, she must tap the abilities of the versions of herself who are more successful than she is; this means every one of them. She is the worst version of herself. Naturally, she is confused, particularly when she discovers that the ultimate evil that threatens all realities is her daughter.It certainly gives Miss Yeoh a chance to stretch her acting muscles and the editing is wonderful. This sort of story is an enjoyable "wheels of time" story, and tackles the nihilism at the heart of the subgenre: if every decision you make was decided differently in another universe, what difference does it make?My cousin enjoyed most of it but thought the ending sentimental. I thought the sentimental ending was appropriate. What a pity the industry hasn't made better use of Miss Yeoh!
10 An Asian woman in a middle age crisis suddenly is informed that there is a MULTIVERSE and she is the only who can save from total distraction.From there; everything is absolute madness, violence and many humorous situations for a trip of almost two and half hour.No, is not SPIDERMAN and even the SCI-FI suddenly becomes more of a metaphor. It is never boring (perhaps a little too long) but everything that happens becomes absolutely logic by the end.Michelle Yeoh is excellent and I hope she at least get a nomination. Jamie Lee Curtis also very good as always. The rest of the cast is on the same level.It is not worth to explain more; but you have to see it to believe it.
10 2022 is not even halfway over, but I saw Everything, Everywhere last night, and I simply cannot imagine it not being the best film of 2022.To say I was stunned is an understatement. I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I've watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.Last night's screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It's hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It's the fiercest performance I've seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I've seen in years.As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.I don't rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.And at the end of the day, maybe that's everything.
10 As a fan of A24, I knew nothing about this film & I'm happy that I didn't because this film was insane. Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) is a must-watch for A24 fans.
9 What makes this film exciting is not its premise, but its execution. Each scene demonstrates the creativity and silliness of the filmmakers, as well as the talent of the actors to pull off such caricatures. The cherry on top is the beautiful message of the film; it somehow grabs you and doesn't let go.
9 Wow, what a movie. Being able to be so wacky yet so profound is difficult, but this movie is able to to do it all at once(no pun intended)! The main characters exploration of her relationships with her father, husband, and especially her daughter ground the movie, but it's willingness to turn the mundane what if scenarios that we make up in our heads into plot points is truly something special. While it drags on just a tad near the end, this movie is a must watch, and expect it to get some Oscar nods this coming year.
4 They tried, yes, they did, but what's most annoying about this movie is the below average acting performances. French and Dawn's appearance (not funny) dont make things any better. There are lots of silly accents and lots of scenes with over acting. Annoying.More bad:the utter tediousness of this story. It lasts a whopping 2 hours and a bit and this story only starts going after an entire hour. And even then it's quite tedious to watch.No humor. (not my kind) No suspense. Really none at all. What's left? An average detective, really below average...The story: lots of folks travel on a cruiseboat. Someone dies. Who did it?
4 Hercule Piorot is holidaying in Egypt when he is invited aboard a cruise down the Nile. The host is the extremely wealthy, recently married, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. The journey is soured by the appearance of Jacqueline de Bellefort, the ex-flame of Ridgeway's husband. Ridgeway stole him away from her and she seems intent on extracting some sort of retribution. When Ridgeway is murdered suspicion naturally falls on de Bellefort but she has a cast iron alibi.I should have known better than to watch this having watched Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express. Everything about it seemed flat and listless: paint-by-numbers adaptation, minimal intrigue (especially for a murder-drama), subdued, uninspired performances (despite an all-star cast), mindless action scenes.Where Branagh did dial things up was on the cinematography and effects but even there it falls flat: all the effects just make everything seem fake. You can tell it's being filmed in a studio in front of green screen rather than out in the snow with a real train.Having watched the excellent 1974 version it was a definite sub-standard effort. It felt like the classic Christie tale had been dumbed-down for modern audiences and substance sacrificed for style.Murder on the Nile is largely more of the same: weak, dumbed-down adaptation, listless performances, style over substance. The graphics and cinematography at least feel less fake here and are in fact the only positive as they do provide a richness of colour and a vibrance to proceedings.The screenplay is cringy at times with all the unnecessary add-ons to the novel to accommodate modern viewers. Performances are shrill and irritating. Casting is off: so many dud choices. I assume Branagh only wanted French and Saunders in the film because he's a fan of them as a comedy duo, not because they were ideal for their roles (as they're not).Similar to how I ended my review of Murder on the Orient Express, watch the excellent 1978 Peter Ustinov version instead. Or watch the relevant episode in the brilliant David Suchet Poirot series. With those already in existence I don't know why this film was made.
4 Alone the first scene is a fine example that many of today's movie producers, writers and directors too many times don't understand much about what they write about or produce (or they just don't care - I don't know what's worse): take the first scene, the attack in the war of the trenches. The French use gas to hide themselves and instead of putting on their gas masks (well, gas is dangerous, isn' it?) and taking preparation for an attack (the use of gas almost always indicated an immediate attack), the Germans just say, hey, I can't see a thing, just lets stare around a little bit more or just keep on eating your soup. Next scene, we get some Blues tunes that are fine but, well, the movie plays in 1937, but the first electrical guitar ever build was a Rickenbacker in 1936, and the Blues style played belongs to the 40s and 50s... I just give you that two little examples to illustrate why the whole movie just feels wrong and even dumb sometimes - the characters of course behave and talk also out of time and place. Anyway, watchable, if you like the starred actors but compared to the movie of 1978, this one looks weak.
2 Please, please no more remakes of what were once great movies. Kenneth Branagh has gone from bad to worse with this. Everything is so false about it, the cgi so bad. Acting is terrible, as is cast. Why do people want to make remakes of movies which were truly the best.
4 By comparison, this is multiple levels below recent mainstream mysteries Knives Out and Murder on the Orient Express. The mystery has some intrigue but not much. The pacing is off and it takes a while (over an hour) before the mystery actually begins. I'm not a fan of the tone or the music. The actors are frequently over-the-top, sometimes reaching cartoonish territory.Overall, this movie is not put together very well. And I found it only mildly entertaining when I wasn't bored. (1 viewing, 2/14/2022)
2 I suppose you could say this is a fake film for fake times.It looked surreal because it was surreal.Yes, it looked spectacular and lavish, but it was just not real.Just about everything was created on a computer, no trip to Egypt required.The day will come when CGI is so good there will be no need for actors and actresses. It will all be created by software.Rather than follow an established story with the same characters the need to force feed the viewer with PC wokery had to be catered for first.So we had, characters left out, characters introduced, names changed, genders changed, nationalities changed, ethnicity changed, same sex relationship introduced ... what a mess.Ironically, the outing of same sex relationship by Poirot in the reveal was callous and cruel. It played no part in the plot at all, in fact the portrayal of Poirot was way off the mark.Sophie Okonedo was the best thing in it, she was superb and disappointing that she was wasted in this poor adaptation.Both the TV drama (2004) and the 1978 film were better than this attempt, both being shot on location with actual REAL locations.Watch the 1978 film, it is much better and follows the original plot far more closely.
27 March 2022 I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual "solving" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright "Cui bono?" It makes it clear this is written for very low brow audience.
5 First off, great cast and amazing acting, the leads had chemistry and the emotions felt authentic. However, the score and cinematography were mediocre borderline poor. It was painfully obvious that every set was green screen. The score left too many dead moments. Also, what was with that very weird Gadot as Cleopatra moment?!
4 2 out of 5 stars.Death on the Nile is a boring mystery film that does not improve from its previous film. And the sequel is no better. Besides putting the film in a beautiful set piece on a boat and beautiful visual effects of the Nile river and Egypt setting.The film does have a promising cast ensemble. Kenneth Branagh does great with the role. The newcomers like Annette Being, Russell Brand, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Letitia Wright and many others are all talented.The script drags the story. The direction is slow and boring. Every clue is revealed slowly, and when the twist is revealed. It is no surprise or giving you that thrill. I found the film to be boring and slow. The story is decent. The direction and script could have been so much better for a whodunit kind of film.
2 Terrible acting in this 2 hour play.Someone said it's an expensive movie. It really doesn't feel expensive at all. Almost like it's was recorded in the same studio they make children's shows.
1 The opening scene tells all you need to know. Twerking dance in 1936!!! That is a sure sign of desperation which is obvious in the rest of the movie. No authenticity, horrible acting, atrocious directing. Full of horrible CGI scenery that a 10 year old can tell its fake.Save yourself money and time and watch the 1978 version with Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Or better yet see TV series played by David Suchet. Both are 100 times better and sensible that this absolute garbage of movie.
1 Kenneth Branagh has a lot to answer for - not the least of which is his hubris in thinking he can improve on the brilliant Agatha Christie stories and previous screen adaptations of some of her favorite novels. Worse, Branagh changes the fundamental traits and personalty of Christie's Hercule Poirot. Where the hell does he get off? Then, he tries to compensate with overproduced, overblown "movie magic" which may impress some but not true Chritie afficionados. This is a continuation of the same tricks he tried to pull with his shameful "Murder on the Orient Express." He should be ashamed. I think the next item on his assasination list is "Evil Under the Sun." Please, God, no!
4 Look, I really do think that Branagh is a compelling, entertainment-focused filmmaker and performer. He's usually fully committed, lively, and even somewhat imaginative. But when the material isn't good, those traits are nearly impossible to see behind his seeming obliviousness to the mediocrity on display. With Orient Express, the whodunnit plotting and characters are engaging; not so much here.
2 I hope Agatha Christie is haunting the director, editors, and writers from beyond, for besmirching her good name. I don't blame the actors, but the first half of this way too long movie was awful. In one scene, a character info-dumped the backstories of every other character and described why they would be a suspect in a future murder that hadn't even happened yet, which was some of the worst show-don't-tell and infodump writing I've ever witnessed. The glitz and glam is gratuitous and detracts from the story at times... every frame seemed hyper-photoshopped, to the point of looking cartoonish. I don't know whether the pandemic or political tensions prohibited them from using a drone for aerial footage of Egypt, or if stock footage wasn't available, but the CGI landscapes were painfully noticeable. Dialog consisted almost entirely of pithy one-liners, and no real conversations between characters were there to help develop characters, their relationships, or the story. There were a lot of characters, and I felt connected to none of them.The second half of the movie improved a bit, but suffered from Poirot seemingly magically knowing information that hadn't been revealed to the viewers. If you show it to us and we don't catch on until Poirot explains it, that's on us and is part of the thrill. If you don't show it, or show it only in retrospect, then I fault the movie makers for making the movie seem far-fetched and for me losing interest.
2 Murder on the Orient Express it was not .That was an enjoyable movie, not great, but entertaining and well written and excecuted . And of course an excellent cast .This debacle was none of that ; a disjointed screenplay, a cast not worth remembering - an adaption of the novel you certainly do not want to remember .Cringy , forced stereotypical dialogue and characters , poor camera work, editing, and cheap green screen recording for most of the film .To add insult to injury, a diversity cast was forced into the movie, in such a hamfisted fashion, and with such unlikable characters , that ironically it will most likely have the opposite of the desired effect .Avoid - it's boring at best, annoying in many places .
3 I have few words to say, 2hrs is a long time in this world that we live in and to do this to your audience is very cold. I need an apology, and my time back but i won't get it, would I? Well at least it had some beautiful cast. Before I forget, the liberties taken for movie from the source material didn't work. What were Sophie and Wright's characters doing there?
4 If one were to compare the 2022 version with the 1978 evergreen classic of the same name then this latest one is an extreme and massive disappointment with terrible acting by everyone in the film including KB.However if one were to judge on its own then at best it's a below average movie with absolutely nothing praiseworthy at all.4/10.
1 When will Hollywood learn? Stop and compare how often changing an iconic character works versus how often it ends in massive, colossal failure. If you want a different character, then feel free to create one. There are so many things I could criticize, but I probably could have overlooked most of them and given a decent rating. What I can't excuse is creating an idiotic back story for Poirot's mustache and then having him shave it off at the end. NO NO NO!!!! Not in any alternate universe would anything short of life and death convince Hercule Poirot to shave his mustache. While the term canon is often overused to refer to a fan's favorite version of a character, it does exist. And Poirot being a "dandy" (that means prissy, not gay) who's obsessively proud of his mustache definitely qualifies as canon. It is reiterated in every single Poirot story. And adding insult ti injury, it's for a woman who never existed in the books when every Poirot fan knows his only love ever depicted is the countess Vera Rossakoff. These stories were written by the brilliant Agatha Christie, who is one of the best selling authors of all time. Nearly a century after Poirot first appeared people are still reading his stories. They don't need to be improved upon. And even if they did, this wasn't it. This was a travesty. I may never watch another Kenneth Brannague film. I most certainly won't watch any future Poirot films he makes. This was an insult to the character, the author, and the tried and true Christie fans.
4 From the opening shot of a CGI crow swooping through a World War One trench it is obvious this film detaches from reality and plays out like a comic book.The Egypt depicted in this film is a deserted sterile place: everything is CGI and there are hardly any extras.This is shot in a distractingly arty fashion with characters viewed from behind windows, railing or ceiling fans.There are some really gaudy, atmosphere-breaking scenes: like when a body is carried out on the shoulders of identically and immaculately dressed female crew members with the gravitas of a state funeral - but with an audience of ten.Characters are shot at extreme close up or from miles away - rarely anything in between.The script is slow and stogie, most characters just roll out monologues, sometimes whilst looking at another cast member, but rarely interacting.I am a big Christie fan and I like many of the adaptations (including the last Orient Express) but this was really dull and boring.The characters felt very flat, only existing to relay their one defining characteristic before fading into the background.This feels very much like watching someone playing a computer game, the player going from one task to the next, each character encountered programmed with the bare minimal of personality to progress the level.
1 Everybody's over acting like they were amateurs in a fifth grade school play. The actors running around in fancy clothes in front of green screens and cgi. The dialogue are uninspired, not realistic and not taken from the book. The characters are woke and thin as card board. I found it all to be boring and uninteresting.
3 Holy smokes, the production is very bad on this one, tbh the amount of green screen scenes probably surpasses the number used in The Black Panther, and that's something!Sometimes it's so bad it doesn't even look like a film made in this century. The fake blurry background in quite honestly all scenes that take place outside is really distracting and just looks awful.Cheap production, low-grade acting. Story/writing average at best.Overall pretty bad.
3 After all the delays (this was scheduled for December 2019, even before the pandemic!), the Armie Hammer scandal and after all this time I almost forgot Poirot was to return. But once I finally saw this movie, I felt nothing. It's directed with a classy style but with too much of CGI and modern visuals and that mix is jarring. The performances are not that good to me (Benning may be my favourite, just her) and the storyline has a few moments and a watchable resolution but the pacing drags a lot on its first hour to me. I wanted it to be better or as decent as 'Orient Express', but clearly it was not. I yet recommend everyone to see the movie and judge by themselves. It's just I felt nothing watching it and that's a shame (after all the waiting) and a sadly steady pattern very much present in mainstream nowadays.
1 Boring and pretentious interpretation of a great story.Death on the Nile is just another in a series of unnecessary productions that just shows that today's film industry has neither the quality nor the desire to make a good film that will intrigue the viewer and keep him in suspense.With a few solid actors and a few catastrophically bad ones, this film can't offer much. The script is bad, the dialogues are forced, and the actors seem to be bored.I didn't last until the end of the film, because it was simply boring and pretentious. Every movie looks the same, even those set in the past.Writers cannot refrain from destroying the classics. The film looks artificial, with visible CGI, the practical effects still look better. Everything seems forced and shallow, but that's how most movies look today.The script is bad, with hilarious dialogues and forced situations. I was expecting at least great set design, but even that looks too fake. This may have been really interesting, but in the end, this is just another boring movie.Boring, pretentious and unimaginative.A complete waste of time.
4 Just got back from watching "Death on The Nile" & I'm not even lying when I say Kenneth Branagh has chosen to shoe-horn in a WW1 related backstory to show why Hercule Poirot has a moustache... As if we needed an explanation, detailing the reason for a character's facial hair.At this rate, Hollywood will be giving us an origin story for Agatha Christie's bikini wax.Seriously though, the most suspenseful thing was the unmasked woman conspicuously coughing (continuously) throughout, further down the aisle of the cinema. It's a superficial adaptation, worsened by Kenneth Branagh's artificial direction, bad VFX, amateurish continuity errors & horrendous chewing of scenery by actors giving some of the worst performances of their careers.
5 Turned in her grave, on plenty occasions in this edition of the death on the nile. I guess peter ustinov wouldve kikced his anckle too cause this edition of the poirot story is made for the new generation of agathae christie fans, not grumpy old peoople like me. How could he have forgotten his stick, and forlorn his bowler hat...IMPOSSIBLE'...enjoy it for what you want, but apart from some great vantage views of the nile and some workable cgi's here and there, this wasnt more ,than looking at a stage play in the london theater district, and the sets no more than a bbc tv theater. Best of british cast, but they can not rewrite the story again.enjoy the flicks from the past,they are way better.
31 March 2022 Ti West's movie really should have been called "E" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the "Director" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the "crew" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.
8 I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).
6 An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.
6 In 1979 a group of people rent a cabin to make an adult film in rural Texas. The owner is less than pleased and has issues of his own with his wife.The film is over-hyped. It does have two creepy looking old people who look like something out of Texas Chainsaw. The soundtrack was top rate, as is anything that includes Mungo Jerry. It also has the throwback nudity many horror films have started to avoid. This film reminded me of "Bread Crumbs."Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Mia Goth, Brittany Snow)
7 In 1979 a bunch of young filmmakers set out to rural Teaxas to film a porno film. They rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere from an old guy. They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick! Worth a look but the buildup to the blood and guts is kind of slow.
5 While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.
5 5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a "sexy slasher" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes.
8 I saw X, starring Mia Goth-Suspiria, Everest; Jenna Ortega-Scream_2022, Iron Man 3; Brittany Snow-the Pitch Perfect movies, John Tucker Must Die; Martin Henderson-Grey's Anatomy_tv, Everest and Kid Cudi-Don't Look Up, Need For Speed.This movie is-in the words of one of the characters-one F$#@^& up horror movie. I will say, it is original. It takes place in 1979 Texas-it was actually filmed in New Zealand-where a group of young filmmakers go to a rural farmhouse to make an adult movie. Martin is the producer that rents the farm location and Mia, Brittany and Kid are the films' stars-and yes, there is graphic nudity. Jenna is handling the equipment behind the camera. One of the first things you notice is that there is something odd about the old couple that own the farm, especially the old woman. Slowly, things become clear about the intentions of both of the farm owners and it gets bloody violent. FYI: Don't leave until after the end credits because there is a scene you do not want to miss and I read that the sequel-actually a prequel-will be out later this year.It's rated R for bloody violence and gore, drug use, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.I loved this horror film and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.
2 Boring. Pointless. Unrealistic (old people who can barely stand upright are somehow capable of killing a group of young adults!!!). Can't believe people are rating this movie so highly!!!
1 Instead of getting a horror movie of the 70's, you watch a group of junkies going to make a porn movie on a farm, which turns out to be nothing but a long drawn out build-up, before they get wiped out but one. Some people call it a slow burner, but they're wrong, it doesn't even get lit.
6 A decent slasher, but does not deserve a 96% rating on RT. The kills felt conveniently cheap and honestly everything was underwhelming. I was hoping to to feel paranoid or scared, but didn't feel much of anything. Spent most of the movie hoping it would get better or surprise me a little but we've seen this all before.
9 A very stylish rendition of original porn leading to some brilliant horror set in 1979 that is well written and fun to watch! X is surprising in all the right ways and very weird reminds me of M. Nights The Visit just more extreme. I was surprised to see Sam Levinson's name in the credits I love him and his projects! Ti West created something special, I've seen a couple of his films he seems to gear towards disturbed older folks which is quite effective.
4 This isn't like Ti West's other films. It's tasteless garbage with a few good scenes scattered throughout that end up being meaningless when the film descended into complete nonsense and shock value.
8 Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.
4 I expected a lot more from this movie. It felt a lot like a reboot of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Too many similarities and the overall story is hardly believable. Disappointed as Ti West has made some good movies before. This is not one of them.
3 My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !
5 A man looking for a get rich quick scheme decides to make a porn film on a Texas ranch in the video days of 1979. The place is owned by a creepy old couple who look like ma and pa kettle. The old lady is both horny and violent and a scene with geriatric peop!e getting busy is downright bizarre. The leads are fine but X is only an average horror movie.
4 After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.
5 This is technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movies best qualities.But the direction they take with some of the "horror" late in the movie is off-putting. I understand what they are going for. I understand that's the point. And the point does come across. It still doesn't change how I felt. Which was unsettled, not scared.Some people might like that type of "horror" (like Gabe from The Office lol). I am not one of those people. It's unfortunate because it's a good setup that just doesn't land for me. (1 viewing, opening night 3/17/2022)
10 X (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres tonight. The storyline follows a production crew who rents an old house from a very old couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas to film a porno. As they make an outstanding porno hoping to change the industry forever they get some visitors looking to fulfill their own fantasies.This movie is directed by Ti West (The House of the Devil) and stars Mia Goth (Suspiria), Jenna Ortega (Scream), Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect), Kid Cudi (Don't Look Up), Martin Henderson (The Ring) and Owen Campbell (My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell it To).I love everything about this movie, how can you not like a slasher porno movie? The storyline is excellent and unfolds perfectly. This is a rare unique slasher film that horror fans have been clamoring for. I really liked the characters, the twists and turns and the full circle ending. The cast was perfectly selected. The cinematography and camera angles are out of this world, as is the use of lighting, sounds and the soundtrack. The kill scenes, gore and blood splatter are on point. The jump scares are perfectly executed and very well done with no cheese.This movie gives horror fans everything they want in a horror movie. I could watch this 100 times. I would score this a 10/10.
4 ... there'd be plenty of flesh and gore and comical carnage to see, with disfigured torsos, extreme loss of blood flow, and attempts to escape but not being able to quite flee.... and it would be better than this.
7 "X" is a very bloody, and satisfying horror film from A24 that is able to pack enough scary moments, while also talking it's time to develop its characters.The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great. It's a very bloody movie and the final 40 minutes are amazing. It's also a very good looking movie. It's very well shot and there's a lot of creepiness to it. And finally I actually felt that the villains in this movie were actually very well portrayed. They were given a somewhat tragic issue, and it really added a lot to them.Now I do have a few negatives. The first being that I do wish there was a little more crazy moments. I wish the movie had just a little more bloody moments. I also felt that the first act, while good, was a little too slow paced. I wish it do move a lot faster. And finally there are some things aren't fully explained towards the end.Overall "X" is a very bloody good time with great acting, great direction, and some truly bloody moments.
5 I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots.
8 Ti West is an incredibly astute visual director, and with X, he continues to show this. He turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.That being said, West has never impressed me with his writing before. His earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. Thankfully that's changed with this one. This is probably West's most character-filled film.Every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. The protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. Each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.It's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.Additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and I didn't get attached to them in the way I think West wanted me to.Still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than I was expecting.
5 Whilst I appreciate the way this was shot which gave it a 70s grindhouse horror feels, I was bored. I can't remember the last time I checked my watch so many times throughout a movie.First hour is an incredibly slow burn of the characters shooting a porn movie, that hour isn't used for character development or anything that is important to the movie. The horror part is the final 45 minutes.Whilst there were a few good kill scenes it didn't save the movie. Paired with some lousy acting which was partly intentional giving the theme of the movie the only good performance coming from Mia Goth.With a muddled twist at the end I came out shaking my head. Not a terrible movie but not one that I'd recommend to my horror movie friends and no doubt I won't remember it in 6 months.I'm guessing the higher reviews are based on artist efforts rather than the story itself and the movie as a whole. I was looking forward to a great horror movie based on reviews but was sadly disappointed.
5 Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!
3 Have just came back from a screening of this & must say I wasn't impressed!The film sees The Batman taking down The Riddler who plans to unleash devastation across the city! Batman must try & stop him before all hell breaks loose!I found the film to be boring, depressing & most importantly, too long at a staggeringly bad, 2 hours & 47 minutes!! Whoever was hired as editor needs to be shot as this was unacceptable! Easily, a good hour could've been exercised from this mess of a film with a plot so stretched you don't know what's what! Like other films of this kind, the pacing & runtime seem to have this effect on the story where is drags out soo long that you forget/can't make ends meat with the story! The dark tone while fitting was a bit too dark for its own good! Even the story itself was pretty naff & failed to interest me! There was also 1 line regardingr being mentioned, along with the implicated message which was out of order & typical of Hollywood today, which I felt was pretty unnecessary, not to mention a few other things which I didn't appreciate that were unneeded in the film!Patterson was alright for Batman & the effects & action were good! Some eye candy here & there with Zoe Kravitz wasn't bad either!Overall, it's heavily overrated! It's too long, too boring & dull to the core with a weak story-line that's stretched to breaking point!3/10.
5 THE BATMAN (2022) is a movie where my expectations lowered as it got closer to opening night. However, unlike most people, lowering my expectations means exactly that and nothing more. I didn't expect The Batman to be great. But that doesn't mean that I liked it just because I had low expectations. I don't give passes to awfulness or mediocrity, but ESPECIALLY when it's a high budget, hyped film like The Batman with a pretty reputable director and cast. While this troupe of actors isn't exactly Godfather caliber, they are nothing to sneeze at either. Robert Pattinson has gained a lot of traction over the years slowly removing himself of the universally panned Twilight movies. And in particular John Turturro, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, and Paul Dano are very well respected in the film industry. Even Andy Serkis is highly regarded for his physical and voice acting in the 2010s Ape movies. Zoe Kravitz is really the only questionable casting. But from this overall reputable cast, I thought that the acting was good at best. Save for Paul Dano as The Riddler, none of the performances really stood out as anything more than serviceable.To the elephant in the room, how was Pattinson as Batman? I dare say that Pattinson low-key reverted to his Twilight days of being overly broody, moody, and staring too much in this film. The dialogue did the actors no favors, either. It was very bland and lacked genuine humor or wit. Also very weirdly, Pattinson was way more verbose as Batman than he was as Bruce, who did a lot of that awkward staring at people in the scenes where Bruce was featured, which were few and far in between. And when he would stare as Batman, I just didn't feel a sense of fear or danger coming from him. I felt like you could put any actor of decent physical stature in this costume and he would just as intimidating as Pattinson, which isn't saying much. Pattinson's "acting" was just a bunch of staring and scowling at people throughout the movie. He was too stiff and emotionless like a statue. As for his character development, there really wasn't any. He just brooded and moped through most of the film then at the end flipped a switch and realized that his true goal was helping people instead of getting revenge. Saving the subway mugging victim wasn't helping? Playing detective with Gordon wasn't helping? Saving Selina from herself wasn't helping? He's been playing vigilante crime fighter for 2 years and putting criminals behind bars. How is that not helping people?Next, to Zoe Kravitz. From what I've seen of her in a few other things, including the Divergent franchise she's really not much of an actress. And this film did nothing to change my mind. She was OK as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, but nothing special. In fact, I feel like Selina's entire arc was awkwardly shoehorned into the movie and could not have even existed. Why was I supposed to care about Selina and this Russian girl? They had barely one scene of Batman scoping their apartment as they apparently argued then a few scenes later her dead body is in a trunk and I felt nothing. Then there was the cliche and uninspired reveal that Selina was Falcone's daughter. I just blankly stared at the screen when she revealed that information. And in the climactic scene where she went to kill Falcone, she was useless. Then the writers made up for it by having her randomly be there to save Batman in the climax. Never mind how someone as small as her could have the strength to pull up a man twice her size. Also, I must be the only one on the planet who thought her mask looked silly and her pixie hairdo was awful. And Kravitz is extremely good-looking, so why the bad haircut? But mainly, Kravitz and Pattinson had zero chemistry. I felt nothing from their various interactions. This film didn't need her character nor this "love story" at all.As for the remaining cast, the various actors Turturro (as Falcone) Wright (as Lt. Gordon), Dano (as Riddler), Farrell (as Penguin), and Serkis (as Alfred) did their best with an odd script. As mentioned before Dano was able to somehow generate a performance approaching greatness from the limited script. I actually expected Farrell to be the standout, but his performance was reduced to him just being physically unrecognizable and sporting a different voice. But Penguin as a character was just kind of there like everyone else. With the possible exception of Gordon, all other iterations of these characters have been done better. I have more of a problem with very minor roles in this movie, just a bunch of bland, interchangeable characters who could have been played by any actor, like the D. A., the lady Mayor, twin bouncers at the club, the uniformed cop who called Batman a freak. None of these people felt believable or unique to me nor left any kind of impression. None of the conversations and character interactions in this film had any kind of emotion, staying power, or re-watchability. It was just characters exchanging stiff dialogue in the blandest possible way.A big problem with this movie is it's running time. It's almost 3 hours long and feels every second of it. Stuff just happens. The movie jumps from scene to scene in a random fashion. Scenes are stretched out due to a bunch of awkward silence and staring and Batman SLOWLY walking around. The main plot, which is based on the Riddler's riddles, is very thin. Somehow, Batman is able to solve every riddle within seconds just to move the plot forward. And at times they don't make sense. Selina would always just randomly show up at the spot where Batman and Gordon were investigating. Then there's the music. The now iconic score just plays endlessly in the background throughout the entire film, many times feeling unearned. I really found the humor to be strained in this film. It wasn't cringe so much as forced. The writers tried to be more nuanced and subtle with the humor, but it just didn't land for me. There were a couple of mild chuckles, but that's about it. Then there's the agenda-riddled dialogue like when Catwoman said the "white privilege" line. I could feel and hear the collective groans in my movie theatre when she said that line. I don't know why Hollywood is so hellbent on inserting cringe stuff like this in virtually every major film nowadays.Also there's the plotholes and inconsistencies. Why is Oswald even called The Penguin in this? He's not supposed to inherit that nickname until much later when he becomes a big crime boss. Why did "Penguin" run away from Batman, resulting in that car chase? Batman isn't a cop and has no right to arrest him? Penguin is protected by Falcone, who owns the police force and the D. A. He could have just given himself up to Gordon and then Falcone would have quickly got him off the charges. Why was the Russian girl's body in the trunk and not disposed of immediately? Speaking of the car chase, it felt like it was shoehorned in just to have a cool scene that was a callback to the one in Batman Returns (the best Batman film ever, btw), except in that movie the Batmobile was under Penguin's control. What was Penguin going to do, leave town? It would have made more sense for him to just let Gordon arrest him and ignore Batman completely since he's not a cop and has no authority or jurisdiction. Why didn't Batman or Gordon care about all the lives that were lost in that highway explosion that they were partially responsible for? They acted like none of that happened and just kept interrogating Penguin and moved on. What's the purpose of Batman helping the police solve crimes and saving people from subway attacks, then turn around and cause highway explosions causing collateral damage? Penguin is a protected mobster who can get away with anything. So what if Gordon arrests him? He'll be out that same night. Why did Riddler just give himself up? Are these writers telling me they wrote this LONG detective story based on a villain who was just going to turn himself in at the climax? So what was the purpose of even telling the story? That means that Batman and Gordon and all their detective work were useless and a waste of time. Then to top it off, Riddler stupidly tells Batman about his big evil plan using his followers. If Riddler doesn't give himself up and says nothing, he wins.The positives are the cinematography, atmosphere and action scenes, thus why this film can at least be called mediocre. The look of Gotham is neo-noirish enough to give a comic book feel and the constant raining and dreariness immerses you into the world. The action scenes are cool, but I swear that the 75% of them were in the trailers, so when I saw them in the movie, it was literal deja vu. The subway beatdown, the club shootout, the car chase...all given away in the trailer. This movie felt more like a super long, rambling, meaningless detective story with a bunch of random characters cosplaying the iconic hero and villains rather than feeling like lived in versions. Interestingly, this director Matt Reeves directed Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the first sequel to the far superior Rise of the Planet of the Apes, directed by someone else. So it's not surprising that because so many people overrate Dawn and think it's better than Rise, I'm also seeing a lot of people already overrate The Batman as one of the best Batman movies. Reeves has a tone that appears to appeal to a lot of people, but not this moviegoer. Since it's already a given there will be 2 sequels to The Batman...better luck next time.
5 I just don't enjoyed it at all. It's too long, bored me to dead. I loved the previous Batman movies but this isn't as good as these movies . Moreover,It's ratings make me sad and laugh at the same time. It's not good enough compared to these movies, maybe, I just had too much high exceptions about this which eventually fall flat.... :3.
3 I never cared much for The Riddler and I don't care for him in this movie either. It was such a terrible villain to create because he is so close to being like The Joker. This version of him is exactly like that, but with a bit of a twist.Robert Pattinson is miscast as Batman. I found him to be weak and unappealing. He seems to be straining his voice to copy the other versions of Batman with the deep froggy voice. He has the look though. He never smiles and he has that little head bob when he is talking. I think he got that from Keaton's version.I didn't care for the Batmobile. I didn't care for the care chase except for the end of it which was well done.There was too much whispering in the scenes. Speak up sonny! I can't hear you!The rest of the cast is meh. The Penguin is not the Penguin. Catwoman is underwhelming. I haven't see this much of a miscast of Catwoman since Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry. Alfred is good, but I didn't like his arc. The script has several story arcs in it, but the one main arc leads me to believe this is an alternate Universe Batman.Overall it was OK, but with strings attached. It is really forgettable. It has a lot of lows and a few highs.
10 I'll admit I raised an eyebrow when I saw that Pattinson was cast, but I eat my words, he was awesome, and hopefully will play the part a few more times.This film blew me away, exciting, fast paced, surprisingly gritty, and genuinely had an awesome story.The franchise somehow felt renewed here, even if you're not a fan of superhero movies, you will love this.Andy Serkis was genuinely awesome, but when isn't he? The acting throughout was fantastic, with plenty of well known faces.Great music, great special effects, I've already booked to see it again.10/10.
4 STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **
3 I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part "Saw" rip-off and so desperately wants to be "Se7en" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, "We're going to make a better Batman than you." No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, "That's it..." and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... "Pattison". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I "got it". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.
3 Couldn't even finish this drivel... Firstly : Pattinson is a good actor but doesn't fit Batman's role ...Film is way too long and boring , action is underwhelming ...Overall a big disappointment... Can't recommend it at all...
3 Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former. If the producers weren't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe it could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of those irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while playing into the other trope of the psychopathic killer who likes classical music). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.
5 It's outrageous how some people are saying this is better than the Dark Knight movies. This movie doesn't come near any of the dark knight trilogy.It had some really fun scenes like most of the riddler scenes were good. But it just dragged on with so much dialogue that didn't seem to be that important. I'd actively avoid watching this movie again.
5 March 2022 I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's "Everyone is just scared of him." plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.
4 This movie is so overlong that you feel like it's never going to end at some point. I thought it was about to end for a few times and then another scene plays out. That just proves how badly composed and poorly plotted it is. The main problem with it is that it tries to please everyone and ends up being all over the place. The dark theme and psychological elements are probably influenced by Joker and its success, but they have no substance whatsoever. It's just a very artsy and pretentious take on the Batman character that looks very stylish and flashy, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. In fact, it uses familiarity as its one and only promise.
2 Right from the 1st leaked screenshots I had doubts about this movie, wasn't bothered by the fact Robbie Pattinson was playing the main man, moody, morose, silent, he had all the things necessary to portray the brooding Batman, unfortunately he had no screen presence, the Batman's mere look should strike fear, Pattinsons didn't, had the resounding thumps of his Jack boots not been amplified to sound like a herd of elephants it would've been easy for him to go unnoticed among the throngs of police officers & various characters.The only scene that attempted to inject any excitement was the "budget Batmobile" chase scene, overly long, quite pointless & shockingly silly and far far too loud, another problem with this movie, whereas the musical score was for the most part the best thing about this movie it's actual sound was one of the worst, every screech, scream and gunshot was turned up to maximum, deafening the audience.Of course the real villain of this movie is the story or more precisely its lack of one, yes we're introduced to "the Penguin" an overweight balding scar faced slob that screams more sleazy pervert than villain & a complete waste of use of the character then its "the Riddler" a bespectacled "youtuber" in what's best described as a gimp costume, a character with no special talents yet is somehow able to enter unseen an exclusive apartment and commit murder, a locked vehicle to over power it's driver and enter unseen a police gym and over power the cheif of police and kidnap him and all the while screeching like a banshee on video & facetime.The films runtime is far too long telling a story that is uninteresting and ultimately very boring, there are no heroic deeds performed no good guy to root for.The time line for this movie becomes apparent from the diary kept by Bruce Wayne and various TV news broadcasts, this is year two in the career of the Batman yet he isn't the vigilante that's feared by the criminal underground yet he's hated by the police force, with no context to work from of his past deeds as a vigilante its very confusing.Quite simply this isn't a movie about Batman , Pattinson could have played the character without the costume and the movie would have still been the same, a very boring lacklustre detective story.Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman, a character completely different to the Halle Berry version but played equally as badly.Put simply this movie ranks worse Batman movie behind the awful Batman and Robin, as the caped crusader Pattinson isn't a patch on Keaton, Kilmer, Bale or even Afflek.I can only imagine Warner Bros/DC wanted to emulate the profits they raked in from "The Joker" so decided to give Batman the same treatment but where "Joker" stripped away everything and concentrated on the character "The Batman" strips away everything about the character and concentrates on everything else, the sets, cinematography and secondary characters are fine tuned and highly detailed whereas Batman is reduced to a pair of "Jack boots" clumping through the movie.By the end of Matt Reeves "The Batman" I felt I knew a little about what it was like to be in a hostage situation, the elation I felt at the ending of the movie gave newly found strength to my numbed legs allowing me to bound out from the cinema seat seeking the freedom of the evening air, it was a wonderful experience, something I sadly can't say about the movie.Nolans trilogy is still the best, he gave the character a begging a middle and an end and he did it with style all the while telling a complex and interesting story about complex and interesting characters, Matt Reeves fails abysmally with "The Batman" choosing to emulate scenes from past Batman movies rather than creating something new and unseen, from Keatons Bruce Wayne to Bales Dark Knight it's all there easily recognised.If this is Reeves idea of re-booting the character for a new generation then it was a pointless endeavour, the new generation hasn't the need or interest for it, they certainly don't have the patience to sit through 3 hours of it.The movie is about the beginning of Batman's career when he is young, full of the energy necessary to fight the criminals and crime of Gotham city, Pattinsons "Batman" meanders through the movie as if he were a zombie looking disinterested and deflated, this is not a superhero movie nor a movie about a hero, it should not be a movie at all.
10 I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.
2 To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say "gosh get outta my room". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.
4 Robert P is a terrible Batman. Absolutely no Bat-charisma at all. The Riddler character is a complete bore! I hated all of this film. I certainly do not understand the good reviews. It's not close to the Dark Knight caliber. Please do not make a sequel.
5 I'm not sure how I can make my comment any more generic without offending anyone. This movie has a sub-agenda that I thought unprofessional and inappropriate and distracting from the story. Enjoy.
6 Wasn't a fan of Emo Batman. Sorry Robert Pattinson. Film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In the end, the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a run-of-the-mill Superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill. The Riddler was a bit lame too. Forgotten most of the movie and characters already. Underwhelming.5.5/10.
5 Wonderfly shot. Love the serial killer type approach. Matt Reeves never disappoints with choice of color, tone and over all cinematography.That being said, the story wasnt that interesting to be honest. Nothing was surprising or intriguing and because of that, the result was a poor nonthreatening antagonistAs for character casting, Zoe Kravitz is probably the worst Catwoman. Not one Catwoman characteristic was displayed. Might as well get anyone to play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright was surprisingly a good Jim Gordan although i have no idea when Batman had a partner lol. John Turturro just looks too goofy to pull off as some crazy mob boss/supporting antagonist. Colin Farrell was amazing 👊The greatest detective/tactician failed to do any real detective work. Solved a few riddles and off we go. Bale still #1All in all great production, good acting (especially from Pattison and Farrell). Would I recommend watching it? Yea i guess. A second time... probably not.
10 Disclaimer - This is a spoiler free reviewWorries about yet another Batman coming into the fray should be alleviated very quickly as director Matt Reeves version of the caped crusader done by the way of Seven takes hold early on and refuses too let go on its way to a well earned three hour runtime that is full of surprises, atmosphere, historical nods and artistry as Reeve's David Fincher like epic takes us on a memorable Gotham adventure that may divide casual fans, all the while becoming a new favourite for long term fans of DC Comics most famous creation.Those expecting a film similar to Christopher Nolan's duly praised Dark Knight trilogy may find themselves disappointed where Reeves is clearly taking Robert Pattinson's portrayal of the vigilante seeking Bruce Wayne, here caught up in a mysterious game run by the devious Riddler who is targeting high end Gotham figures in a series of grizzly murders, as while Reeve's film does share some similar DNA to Nolan's version of Batman (serious in tone and dark in more ways than one) this is a far less action oriented ride that relishes in the small moments as much as it does when its scattered collection of action does make its way to the forefront.Taking its inspiration from various crime/thrillers found throughout feature film history and undoubtedly featuring a narrative taken from Batman's famed detective oriented tales such as The Long Halloween, The Killing Joke and Year One, The Batman thankfully skips past bothering with yet another origin story as we find Pattinson's bruised and battered crusader of justice two years into his crime fighting life as his become a creature of the night struggling to balance being the billionaire heir his known for and the hero no one understands and by moving past these steps Reeves is allowed to fully focus on the story at hand that allows his creativity as a director and his loaded casts talents to shine.Not a household name but a director whose failed to put a foot wrong since his 2008 breakthrough with Cloverfield and then his continued success with horror remake Let Me In and his double hit of blockbuster goodness with Dawn of and War for the Planet of the Apes films, Reeves with valuable help from Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser and one of composer Michael Giacchino's best scores in years embeds every frame of The Batman with something to take in or be wowed by and the film is easily up there with one of the most impressively put together comic book films and blockbusters in general of the modern era, even if its more slow paced nature and untypical narrative may not be what certain viewers are after from this long-standing property.Also helping out the films cause in a big way is the work of all main players found within Reeve's rain-soaked affair with the likes of Jeffrey Wright as everyone's favourite policeman Lieutenant James Gordon, John Turturro as crime matriarch Carmine Falcone, the unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the very un-Danny DeVito Oz/The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman all putting in good work that is overshadowed by the one-two double punch of Pattinson's tormented Wayne and Paul Dano's skin crawling take on The Riddler, with the two polar opposites giving us something as memorable and close to greatness as we'd ever likely get to Christian Bale's and Heath Ledger's double act in The Dark Knight.A divisive choice early on, Pattinson proves a worthy owner of the famous character with his noteworthy work over the last few years proving to be no fluke and Edward Cullen a mere sparkling dream of yesterday and his both imposing and vulnerable here, a hard mix to get right but one he nails in all instances and while not hogging huge screen time in the overall scheme of things, Dano's work as the films main foe here is menacing, unnerving and glorious to behold with Eli Sunday being transported to the modern era sans his Bible and replaced with wide rimmed specs hidden under a hideous mask, while its a hard task to be considered as dastardly great as Ledger was in his Oscar winning role as Batman's arch rival, Dano does a job that can be considered right up there in the same league as he gives The Batman an unwieldy edge not often found in such fare.There's no question this serious and moody take on Batman's world will be compared often to The Dark Knight with many arguments sure to ensue, if you were to ask me here and now what I think, I would say its unlikely anything will ever reach the heights of Nolan's beloved game changer but this Batman comes mightily close which is some form of mighty feed indeed.Final Say -A very different type of Hollywood blockbuster that also sees Batman taken in a new and exciting direction when it comes to feature films, The Batman is an artistic and considered epic that sets in motion a tale that can't be continued soon enough.5 shades of eyeliner out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
2 I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying "white privileged men" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious "woke" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps. I did like Farrell as the Penguin and the Riddler was basically Dexter the Anti-hero...
9 Detective Batman at its peak! Great storyline. Just as dark a universe as we've come to expect from DC. The gloomy, gritty, dark tone of this film is exactly what I wanted. When you think the movie is over, there's more. Beautiful cinematography. Great score.
2 I wanted to love this movie. I would have settled for hating it. Instead, I was bored for three hours.The movie is a sloppy buffet of darkness, rain, gloom, unnecessary narration, wooden acting, absurd dialogue, pointless characters, canyon-wide plot-holes, unresolved story arcs, flaccid motivation for the bad guys, hyper-fast cuts, eye-rolling detective work, conventionally choreographed fight scenes, a cinematic emo aesthetic, a pseudo-Gothic mis en scene, a complete lack of humor or light-hearted moments of any kind, no soul in the acting, unsophisticated writing, timid directing, and a fully-checked list of boxes from the superhero / vigilante cliche playbook.This is a partial list of my complaints. (If pressed, I could probably find a handful of good things to say, but they'd be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of Meh.)Having grown up on Adam West's Batman, I've lived through the campiness, the avant-garde, the silly, the surreal, and the downright brilliant (I'm looking at you Dark Knight). There have been Batman movies I've loved and ones I've hated. There are some Batman movies my family and I quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re-watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity. This is the first Batman iteration where I was disappointed, bordering on offended at the completely pedestrian effort and the unimaginative, forgettable final product.If you're under thirteen years old, a sucker for three hours of tedious brooding, and if you don't have a bone-deep familiarity with and love of the genre, you *might* enjoy this. Otherwise, if you're a superhero fan and a true movie lover, please please please steer clear of this one!
3 I've seen campy Batman movies from Joel Schumacher, I've seen more grounded/realistic Batman movies from Christopher Nolan, and I've even seen a goofy Batman movie from Chris McKay, but there's one thing I never in my life thought I'd see...a boring Batman movie. Matt Reeves pulled off that unlikely feat with this 3-hour-long drudgery of a film. Admittedly, I'm coming at this as a person who has never clicked with the character of the dark knight. I find Batman to be massively overrated, and I struggle to see why the entire world bows down to him as if he's the greatest superhero of all time. That being said, I can still find entertainment from his stories, and rarely have outright hatred for the films (aside from when Zack Snyder directs them.)The Batman feels like a film made after Matt Reeves spent a great deal of time reading fan discussions on the internet, so it ticks a number of the boxes that I've heard comic book nerds complain about over the years. They make a point of never having Batman kill anyone. I mean, one could argue a few received head wounds that could easily lead to their death, and he caused a car crash that could easily have been fatal, but at least he's not pulling out a gun on anyone or dropping people off the top of a building. Also, all those fanboys love to talk about Batman being the world's greatest detective, so in this movie the first time we see the Caped Crusader, he's literally walking into an active crime scene. It's a ridiculous juxtaposition that made me chuckle, but I'm sure there were some people out there who wanted to applaud that moment.The other aspect of The Batman that had me chuckling when I don't think they intended anything to actually be funny was when we meet Bruce Wayne outside of the mask. First of all, there's another bit of fan service in the fact that we actually see him with black makeup smeared around his eyes. But worse than that is just the exaggerated emo goth-kid look that makes it appear that Robert Pattinson is cosplaying as Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance. There were more than a few scenes where we are looking at Bruce Wayne through a bunch of long greasy black bangs and I was wondering who thought that was a good idea. I will give Pattinson credit for not overdoing the Batman voice too much, and almost always disguising his native British accent.As I said at the start, though, the big problem with The Batman is just the fact that it's boring. The film drags on and even the action sequences feel kind of bland and lacking in memorable moments. There's one car chase that stands out as the biggest moment where I was literally checking the time, because it added nothing to the plot of the film. The entire plot is a non-stop series of tropes that feel like I'm watching someone who wants to do a Tarantino-style homage to other crime-thrillers, but without the talent of Tarantino. The story is slow-moving, and insanely repetitive. I could not believe how many times they returned to the same places and did the same things. There was a complete lack of efficiency in the storytelling, as if no one was willing to cut anything, and I felt there were entire characters and storylines that could have easily gone without hurting the story one bit.The entire movie is built around a big puzzle, which I can get behind. It started developing as though there was a genuine murder mystery for us to uncover. But as things started to move along it became clear they didn't have a reveal that would warrant all the time they spent building it up. As a side note, I think I'll be happy if I never again have to see a scene where a person is questioned about who is the big bad behind everything, and they say they can't tell because something worse than death will happen to them. This only works as a stupid stalling technique to build suspense for the audience, and if you don't have a satisfactory surprise pay-off at the end it's totally ridiculous. Needless to say, The Batman did not have said pay-off. Its biggest surprise was that it wouldn't end because they constantly had one more scene. In every way I found The Batman to be a lackluster movie that somehow made me nostalgic for the days of Schumacher.
8 Following Dr Robotnik's exile, Sonic has settled down in rural Montana with adoptive parents Sheriff Tom and wife Maddie. What follows includes Robotnik's escape, the arrival of additional alien oddities Miles "Tails" Prower, the twin-tailed fox and Knuckles, the aggressive echidna, a marriage in Hawaii, a dance-off in Siberia, mushroom machinery, a Master Emerald, some annoying military intervention, and a giant robot.That sounds like a lot, but it's pretty straightforward stuff in a plot which aims directly at a 3-part audience - kids, tolerant parents, and mature gamers with fond memories of the original games. And I think it succeeds. It's brash, colourful, fast, eventful, funny, likeable, and has some pretty good visuals.It's not Shakespeare, it's dumb, but it's great fun.
8 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the sequel to 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, a film that had a rocky development, but would listen to fans and fix its incarnation to Sonic, resulting in it being well received, and breaking the Detective Pikachu movie's record as the highest-grossing video game-based movie, and the highest-grossing superhero movie of 2020.Here, while Tom and Maddie are going to Hawaii to attend Rachel's wedding to a man named Randall, leaving Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) in charge of the house. However, Dr. Robotnik (played once again by Jim Carey) has managed to escape the Mushroom Planet with the aid of Knuckles (voiced by Idris Elba), whom he repays by taking him to Sonic so he can destroy him. However, just as Sonic is about to be creamed, a police car rams Knuckles, revealing Tails (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessy, the only VA to reprise his or her role from the video games). After finding out Longclaw left a message telling Earth is the hiding place of the Master Emerald, the one thing Knuckles seeks to restore honor to his extinct tribe (as he is the last one left).Now this is another good example of how sequels should be done. Sonic 2 is an epic film, as Sonic teams up with Tails and faces Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles. The cast from the first film returns with some new faces appearing, and the new story is awesome. Jim Carey still hams it up as the evil doctor and even Rachel gets a scene where she can be a heroine. But the best thing about this film is that it brings Knuckles back to being a serious rival to Sonic, compared to the Sega games demoting him to the role of being an idiot since the Sonic Boom cartoon. It makes me wish Sega would make notes if they saw the films, because IMHO, Paramount is basically doing Sonic better than Sega did post-Sonic Adventure 2 (it even goes as far as to give Knuckles a father, something the games would never do).However, if there are some complaints I have, it's that this movie has some scenes that are basically imitating scenes from the first film (the Siberian lounge scene reminds me of the Piston Pit scene from the first movie, only instead of a bar fight, we get a dance off), but this is a good sequel regardless. Don't pay heed to the critics bashing it and watch it if you can and see if it clicks with you.
7 Many sequels go bigger but end up being worse than the original. They lose the essence of what made the original good. That's definitely not the case here. It's much bigger but feels just like the first movie. It's on par with the original in every way, just bigger.I said this in my review of the first movie, every moment Jim Carrey is on the screen is pure gold. I wanted him to be in every scene. His facial expressions are hilarious. Whoever cast him as Robotnik is a genius. It's so perfect. I can't imagine it being anyone else.My only downsides are a few parts that don't really make sense. I chalked it up to being a kids movie but that's not really an excuse. And was I the only one who thought Idris Elba was doing something weird with Knuckles' accent? It sounded like it was switching between an English accent and a heavy New York accent, and sometimes a combination of both. I couldn't stop hearing it.I had a great time with this movie. Two out of two in the videogame genre??? That's unheard of. Keep up the good work. Maybe this is the tide turning on video game movies like it did with superhero movies in the early 2000's. I can only hope. (1 viewing, opening night 4/8/2022)
8 The first Sonic movie was surprisingly competent. This one is even better, incorporating additional elements from the games and sticking to more of an action-adventure plot. It's a kid's movie through and through (way more toilet humor this go-around), but a fun one that never takes itself too seriously. Everyone in my theater was having a great time with it.As with the original, Jim Carrey steals the show as Eggman. This man is 60 years old and yet he has more verve than I do! He's so energetic he sometimes resembles a cartoon more than Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails! While I respect his desire to retire, I do hope he holds on and does the third movie-- there would be such a void without him there.
10 I never knew there was mist in the 4DK experience that was added excitement to a wildly entertaining movie! Sonic 2 is better, bigger budgeted and way more action than part 1. This is an ultimate adventure story of friendship, goofiness, and the bad guys take it up a notch. I loved this sequel quite a bit, I like how the audience clapped at the end bit.
9 Incredibly entertaining and surprisingly sweet- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 improves upon its predecessor by expanding on its worlds and dynamic- executing itself better and better each step of the way. First off, I absolutely love the look of this film. Famously the Sonic CGI was replaced in the last film after an incredibly negative and honestly valid response for the characters original design- and consequently its secondary design could feel a bit rushed at times considering they changed the films main character for a film within 3 months. Not to say it was bad, but it was definitely noticeable how fast they had accomplished this fact before. With this film however, the CGI is absolutely fantastic. Of course I love a more well done and thought out Sonic design, but man do I absolutely love the look of Knuckles in this film and even the look of Sonic's signature sidekick Tails. The expansion of the world in the Sonic universe is also breathtaking, truly making my younger self's dreams come true by finally seeing this universe on the big screen. The film is also incredibly funny and even absurd at times, never taking itself too seriously, and remembering this is a film about a Blue intergalactic hedgehog- focused on fun and heart. Speaking of heart, the film was oddly moving and quite cute in its family sort of setting background with Marsden's returning character and I really enjoyed the dynamic they expanded upon with the human characters as well. Heck, even Jim Carrey's iconic villain seemed a lot better this time around, allowing Eggman to lose his mind, and therefore allowing Carrey to do what he does best. It has a few subpar moments, and a few ones that stick out, but in the end- I enjoyed the heck out of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and I honestly can't wait to watch it again.My Rating: 9.1/10.
8 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is basically everything the first Sonic movie should have been. While the first film wasn't bad per se and perfectly watchable, it was very basic and clearly limited in scope and budget. Still alright overall.Thankfully, with a sequel greenlit it feels like this time the writers and director could do much more. The CGI game characters get more of the spotlight than the Human characters, the jokes land better and there's just much more going on here that fans will recognise from the games. With Tails and Knuckles added into the roster, it adds more character dynamic and banter that fleshes them out more in the story.Robotnik also gets to shine more too thanks to Jim Carrey's performance and having more gadgets and locations to juggle with. The weakest parts of the movie are when Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik aren't on screen, but the scenes are still perfectly watchable and better than almost everything in the first film. There's more locations too and gimmicks to play around with in the movie as well.Without spoilers, fans will be most happy with Sonic 2 and even people who aren't a fan of Sonic will still get a kick out of it. Although this ain't saying much, I can confidently say this is the best Video Game Movie I've seen easily. It really felt like they put their soul and effort into it and kids will have a blast with this. Don't forget to stay to the end for a surprise. There will definitely be a third film coming.7.5/10.
9 A delightful follow up to Sonic the Hedgehog(2020), for anybody that are fans of Sonic, where Tails and Knuckles make an appearance, what fans have been waiting for. And it is fun film for the whole family, and has great effects and good characters, and I also like that everybody much shines here not just Sonic.Now I'll bet Jim Carrey improvised all of his lines, it's like the filmmakers just let Jim Carrey do his thing, cause I'll bet they thought it was funnier than the script. You see he's really milking it for all it's worth.
7 "Sonic The Hedgehog 2" is the sequel to the 2020 video game film adaptation of SEGA's "Sonic The Hedgehog". Starring James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Jim Carrey, as well as the voice talents of Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba, it is a decent continuation that's sure to entertain both fans of the games and the previous film.Sometime after the events of first film, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has taken it upon himself to become a hero that others can rely on in Green Hills, Montana. After causing a great deal of collateral damage foiling a bank robbery, Sonic is forced to housesit for Tom (James Marsden) and Maddie (Tika Sumpter) while the two are attending a wedding in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik (Jim Carrey) has returned from the Mushroom Planet thanks to the help of Knuckles the Echidna (voiced by Idris Elba) to seek out the powerful Master Emerald, which will help them conquer the world. After learning of this, Sonic teams up with his new fox friend Miles "Tails" Prower (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) to stop both Dr. Eggman and Knuckles before they can wreak havoc with the Emerald.What I believe made the first "Sonic The Hedgehog" movie such a success was how it managed to appeal to hardcore Sonic fans while also functioning as an amusing family film in its own right. Something like this is easier said than done because various other movies based on video games have tried too hard to be as close to the original games as possible, alienating uninitiated viewers in the process. Because of how it was able to rise above this common mistake, I rank the first Sonic movie among the best video game related films of all time (although considering the lack of competition, the bar isn't exactly very high). Most of what made its predecessor work so well has been replicated here in the sequel, as it provides about the same amount of entertainment value one might expect from a follow-up.Deviating from the original, this film has a slightly darker tone since the Emerald is shown to be something that could easily destroy all of life as we know it. Because of this, we see Sonic actually treating this as a serious threat, limiting the amount of jokes and wisecracks he makes when attempting to hunt it down. This could be compared to the power of Infinity Stones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where their use has the potential to cause catastrophic damage if it were to fall into the wrong hands. I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate to the games since I'm only a casual fan of the series but it all seems like a typical plot device one would see when playing something related to Sonic the Hedgehog.However, things aren't all doom and gloom since that signature fun factor is still there to prevent things from becoming too bleak. Sonic, who is now joined by his good friend Tails, can be seen dancing off against foes to some catchy songs on his iPhone and snowboarding down mountainous slopes in Siberia. Scenes like these are as fast-paced and likeable as the blue hedgehog himself, elevating the film above the usual onslaught of family movie fodder designed solely towards very small children. To my surprise, Sonic now only seems to use his superspeed sparingly rather than just for the sake of it. Perhaps this was done in an effort to develop Sonic more as a character using his head instead of mindlessly speeding around, or maybe they simply didn't want to show Sonic being way too overpowered. Either way, it is an interesting creative decision.Visually, the film looks considerably better than its predecessor. Years ago, many people on the internet infamously cyber-bullied the makers of the first film into changing Sonic's look, winning out in the end with his current design. Normally I'm against this type of vitriolic attack on filmmakers but after seeing the fixed product, I'd say it was all for the best. I'm not sure how they were able to pull it off, but Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all look well integrated into our world. Scenes where human characters were interacting with Sonic, both physically and verbally, all looked quite convincing, as though there really were an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog sitting next to them or dancing alongside them in a bar.I also like how each of the three characters' distinct colours did a clever job of representing their personality traits. Sonic's blue stands out as he confidently speeds past everybody, Tails's orange highlights his supportive nature, and Knuckles' red perfectly mirrors his angry determination. Whether or not this was done intentionally I'm not entirely sure but if it was, then it was a nice addition the film. With that in mind, it also makes it easier to distinguish each of them from a distance, especially during certain action scenes where many things were happening at once.Like last time, Ben Schwartz does a great job playing up Sonic's cocky attitude to full effect. Although he still has that streak of impulsivity, Sonic this time feels as though he is trying to make an effort to use his intellect rather than just his speed to hunt down the Master Emerald. It was also nice to hear Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprise her role as Tails from the video games, as I can't really think of any other mainstream actors capable of voicing the loveable two-tailed fox. If you enjoyed O'Shaughnessey's voice of Tails in the games, then you are sure to like how she is able to hold her own alongside the rest of the cast. Idris Elba is appropriately irritable and brutally strong as the voice of Knuckles. Elba seems to be voicing Knuckles in the vein of the MCU's Thor in his first appearance, in that he is very powerful and one track minded but ignorant to basic things like food and recreational activities.Jim Carrey's performance as Dr. Eggman was easily my favourite thing about the original film. I remember laughing out loud quite a lot at the over-the-top material the writers gave him to work with. It was almost as though the character has been personally tailored to make use of all his comedic talents. This time, he bears a stronger resemblance to his video game counterpart, complete with a bald head and comically huge moustache, and like before he steals the show in virtually every scene he is in. For a man in his 60s, Carrey still demonstrates a considerable amount of versatility and physical dexterity when playing this iconic villain. I look forward to seeing more of Carrey's version of Dr. Eggman in future Sonic films.As far as video game movies and sequels are concerned, "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" is a fun follow-up that is able to recapture what made the original a success in the first place. It isn't afraid to be goofy fun if it wants to be but it also doesn't shy away from serious moments whenever it feels necessary. If you liked the first film, then it stands to reason that you should like this one as well. Judging by the mid-credits scene, it seems there are some more surprises on the horizon so Sonic fans definitely ought to stay tuned.I rate it 7/10.
10 This one was better than Sonic 1. It had better Jokes, more violence, and better characters!! This is also a perfect kids movie, with only two adult jokes!! Jim Carrey returned for the role of Dr. Robotnick and boy did Jim Carrey over act. It had more overacting than the first one but it is funnier!! Great movie go watch it!!
9 4.5 out of 5 stars.Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a really good action adventure film that adults and children will enjoy. It is a bigger and more epic sequel to the original. Fans of the game series will love. The story is bigger. Taking Sonic and Tails on a adventure for the emerald which Robotnik and Knuckles is after.The film does have a lot of action sequences that are bigger and intense. The visual effects are outstanding. The new characters are fun addition like Tails and Knuckles. Robotnik goes through some changes which fans of the game series will love. Especially during the climax with his giant robot battling Sonic and Tails.The cast did great with there roles. The voice talent also did good. The film does have some fun humor. And some cheesy humor which is an eye roll. With the scope of the film with its action. Story and humor. It is forgiven.The film does have a mid credit scene that sets up for a sequel. This film is one fun action packed sequel that goes bigger.
10 The wild, fun and adventurous blue hedgehog we all love, Sonic a.k.a. Blue Justice, is back in his new movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 2! This film has new character appearances, major plot twists, mind-blowing adventures, and tons of laughs throughout it. It's great that this sequel is one of those movies you can enjoy without seeing the original; however, since it refers to different scenes from the first one, you may want to watch the original first.In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, or Dr. Eggman as Sonic calls him (Jim Carrey), returns to Earth with a new ally, Knuckles (Idris Elba), in hopes of finding a magical gem that holds the ultimate power of the universe. All that stands in their way is Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his new partner in crime, Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey). It's a battle of good and bad to see who will reach the emerald first and win in the end.The main characters are Sonic, Dr. Robotnik, Tails and Knuckles. I love how this film introduces characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and they just fit in seamlessly. One of the voice actors who surprised me is Idris Elba. His voice is the perfect match to portray Knuckle's strong and confident personality. My favorite part is when Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) and Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter) are at Rachel's wedding and need to open a portal for Sonic; Tom realizes he may have mistaken the wedding ring for one of Sonic's golden rings. It adds some hilarious adventure to the wedding. Kudos to Junkie XL for keeping an "old school" feel throughout the film with songs such as It's Tricky by Run D. M. C. And Here Comes the Hotstepper by Ini Kamoze.This film sheds light on the importance of having family and friends in your life. They will always have your back and keep you on the right path in life. Sonic and the other characters experience different obstacles that teach them the true definition of a family, even if they come as friends.Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is out of this world. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The "battle of the gem" takes place in theaters on April 8, 2022. Be sure to stay for the after-credits movie scene.

10 Don't believe the critic's they are still mad the first film made more then any of the Disney films that have came out in the past 3 years. Even made more then boring Encanto that some how won on Oscar. Anyways if you want a movie made for adults and children to enjoy this is the film for you. Jim Is hilarious as always. Anyways if you loved the first you will surely love this movie as well.
7 If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.Jeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.Taking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.Fun for kids and adults alike."Rating: B.
7 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022) is a great sequel and might be better than the first movie.Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba were all great as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Sonic and Tails were great together and had a cute friendship.Knuckles was funny in how he didn't understand most things but he is tough and wants to complete his quest for the Master Emerald.Jim Carrey was still great as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman, he is still funny and gives a over the top performance that shows he is having fun with it.The action scenes are fun and awesome seeing with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles interacting off each other. Especially the Sonic vs Knuckles fight, it is worth seeing on the big screen.The 3rd act is amazing and fun while also having Easter eggs from the games that Sonic fans will recognize and find funny. Also the different locations they go to are nicely shot.The after credits scene is amazing and will get you excited for the future of the Sonic movie series. Sonic fans will love it.The movie is fun, funny, and has epic moments that are worth seeing in the theater. The characters are likable and the human characters like James Marsden were also great and funny.
10 I just came back from seeing this film in the cinema and I had a goddamn blast with it! Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a movie that knows what it wants to be and runs with it, resulting in a more fun and enjoyable experience than the already fun and enjoyable predecessor. I won't say much else since I want people to check it out (see the first film before though for more context) for themselves.I'll end by saying two things, bring on the third one, and please let Mario's upcoming movie be good too.
8 It's a blast filled with cringe jokes and some actually funny ones. Maybe just a bit too long but I didn't mind too much. The additional new characters in the movie were great too. What I love most is that there seems to be a lot of love and fun put in when making these films and you can see that when watching it.
7 This film is a very fun time. Sonic and Tails are a delight, Knuckles is epic and the action is great. Jim Carey's energy is amazing as Robotnik and the humour is pretty solid (although its missing the more witty humour the first had at times).However, the film is slightly ruined by the humans. Tom and Maddie are fine and are hardly in the film.But the entire film is utterly dragged down by a 15 minute sequence in the middle involving the bride raging at her wedding being crashed. When Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Eggman don't appear for 15 minutes straight, something has gone wrong. The acting was horrendous in this scene and it was as if an awful cheesy romance film was shoved into a Sonic film.The third act regained some momentum but it started to drag on by the end. If the wedding scenes didn't happen, the pacing would be fine.Sonic becoming Super Sonic was epic, although its weird Robotnik's fate is unclear. The ending was very sweet as well.And that post-credit scene... wow!Overall, Sonic 2 is a fun time but when I rewatch it I'll be skipping the human scenes.
7 This movie definitely felt like a step up from the previous which was good but kind of just felt like a road trip movie that just happened to have Sonic and Robotinik dropped in the middle of it, this one felt more aligned with the items and locations of the games and had a lot more fanservice in it, with more action and comedyI have had a soft spot for the Sonic games, the original 2D games revolutionised 2D platformers at the time, however the 3D games always felt behind innovation though some are better than others. Sonic 06 and Rise of Lyric are definitely the worst ones, though can still be entertaining if you love hilarious glitches and super cheesy writing and scenesThis movie however is still quite good despite having a few flays, Jim Carrey's acting as Robotnik has been taken a step up on the cheese factor and now feels like a full fledged cartoon character with the dial all the way up to 10, than just Jim Carrey pretending to be Robotnik. He even feels more cartoonified than what Eggman was in most of the recent games, but Jim knows how to get into that zone and stay there because he lives and breathes that styleI really liked the addition of Tails in the movie and felt very faithful to the character, Knuckles was good too but kind of felt like he was dumbed down a little compared to the wisecracking character of the games to an extent. I also wasn't a real big fan of his African accent, but it makes sense why they made him that way. I didn't like how Tails was unconscious for almost 20 minutes with no dialogue and it felt lazy to me, like they were compensating for not having enough lines for him in a very cheap way.I did like how the Chaos Emeralds were more focussed upon in this movie aswell as the Master Emerald, and it was fun to see Sonic turn into Super Sonic at the end, though I thought they could have played a bit more with it in that scene and felt it was a bit too short and glossed over too quicklyOverall, I had a fun time with this movie and I think fans will like it a lot too, it felt more like a Sonic adventure in this one and I liked that, maybe we'll see Shadow and Amy make an appearance in the 3rd one.
9 I'm genuinely confused on why critics are going out of their way to try and review these films as if they were trying to be Gone with the Wind. For me personally I felt like this was one of the better video game movies I have ever seen. The addition of the other video game characters and only make this 1000 times more entertaining than the first one. I also felt like the rivalry between sonic and knuckles really worked and you can tell that there was a lot of animosity between the characters which was the point of their rivalry. It's not perfect, or some things with the human characters that are pretty boring and obnoxious. I just don't get why they won't make a movie about the characters from the game themselves and not try and add a bunch of side human characters to further along a less interesting plot. Other than that I really like that I really don't understand why critics are so hard on this franchise. Every complaint that I've seen about this movie they are saying that this is a cash grab for sonic. This is a sonic movie! Why would they not be using elements from the games that are related to sonic if it's a sonic movie? That's ridiculous. Same thing with Uncharted I just think critics are way too hard on these video game movies because of the stigma around them. For me... This is just as good if not better than the first one. Also stay for the credits if you're a fan of a franchise... OH MY GOD!!!
8 As a fan of the games, I had an idea of where the story was going within the first 15 minutes of the film. With that being said, the execution of the plot and writing with both new and returning characters, made the build up to the finale very entertaining and worth my time. It's a little slow at the beginning but once Tails and Knuckles join the cast, it's a thrilling race to the finish; and what a finish it is! There are some twists I didn't see coming and I won't spoil the 3rd act which is the peak of the film. Think Spider-Man No Way Home: Sega version! Yes, the 3rd act is that good and it gave me goosebumps. Very enjoyable film for fans and newcomers alike and definitely STAY for the mid-credits scene.
7 I saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2, starring James Marsden-Westworld_tv, Death at a Funeral; Ben Schwartz-Space Force_tv, Night School; Idris Elba-The Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond; Colleen O'Shaughnessey-The Blacklist_tv, The fresh Prince of Bel_Air_tv and Jim Carrey-Kick_Ass 2, Liar Liar.This is the sequel to the 2020 movie based on the popular video games. Ben voices Sonic, the super fast alien hedgehog that has been adopted by James. When James goes on a vacation, Ben is left to fend for himself until Jim/Dr Robotnik makes his surprising return-he was banished to another planet at the end of the first movie. Idris voices Knuckles, an Echidna alien that is searching for a powerful emerald that happens to be hidden on Earth. Idris teams up with Jim-Jim wants the emerald too-and the race is on as to who can find the emerald first. Ben has Colleen-voicing Tails-to help him. There is plenty of action and humor to keep you entertained-and lots of Easter eggs for the ones familiar with the video games-and there is a scene just as the end credits starts that fore shadows the next movie. Oh yeah, there will be a third. FYI: I don't know if it's true or not but I have read that this will be Jim Carrey's last movie-he is retiring, evidently.It's rated PG for action, violence, rude humor and mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.If you liked the first one, you should enjoy this one too. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.
8 Drags on a bit long though still a refinement on its prequel. Jeff Fowler established every characters into frenetic adventure for whole family. Carrey elevated his quirky villain mode. Knuckles & Tails were capably assembled with Sonic's heartfelt efforts.
8 Such a fun, great movie, tons of easter eggs for those who grew up on sonic too. Everything was perfect. This is how video game movies should be. I can't wait for more. IDRIS was amazing as Knuckles. He was so on point. The man was born to play that role. It was such a great vibe for them to get Colleen to do the voice of Tails. She is Tails. I loved all the easter eggs, the jokes. And most of all JIM. The man is a legend. If This happens to be his last movie ever. What a way to go out. He killed it. Can't wait to own this movie.
8 This was fun but a bit long thanks to the wedding that had no need in the film also unlike the first one there wasn't that much comedy but the action was really good and you gotta love jim carrey however wasn't he fat at the end of the first movie also when he is trying to out run the missiles in siberia why does he need to snow board we all know he can out them in no time felt kinda forced also one other thing that could have been left out was the bar scene it did nothing for the story or movie
i did like knuckles not knowing he was voiced by a girl but you wouldn't be able to tell in this lol and knuckles was perfect and brilliantly acted in wish we could have scene more of sonics powers also this movie could have been like 1 hour 40.20 minutes have been cut just sayin and did sonic ever get his rings back,
8 This movie rocked! Not only the kids acted great, but they were perfect for their roles: cute when they were playing it real, hard when they suffered and inspiring as rock singers. The film uses metal band shenanigans to tell the story of how young people feel and are treated by the world and how they treat each other, but it is never blunt or preachy and allows all characters to evolve. The more I think about the film, the more I like it.Also, awesome song at the end. Not really a metal fan, but even if you don't enjoy the rest of the film that much, the ending song makes it worth it.
7 I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from the 2022 comedy "Metal Lords" from writer D. B. Weiss and director Peter Sollett as I sat down to watch the movie. Why? Well, first of all I hadn't heard about the movie, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. And secondly, then the synopsis for the movie just seemed a bit too generic for a movie of this kind. But still, I opted to watch "Metal Lords".Turns out that "Metal Lords" was actually rather enjoyable. Sure, it was somewhat on the generic side in terms of innovation and creativity for a movie such as this. But still, it proved to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie. And that was definitely a large part because of the cast and their performances. But the storyline certainly was adequate enough.Lead actors Adrian Greensmith (playing Hunter) and Jaeden Martell (playing Kevin) were rather well-cast for "Metal Lords", and they carried the movie quite well.I will say that "Metal Lords" was definitely a movie suited for me, because I've been listening to metal since I was around 11 or 12 years old or so, and been playing roleplaying games for that very same amount of time, and I am almost 47 by now. So the metal references and the Dungeons & Dragons references throughout the movie were as if tailored for my interests.I was genuinely entertained by "Metal Lords", because it was a movie that transcended being just another run-of-the-mill movie about youngsters forming a metal band and going against the mainstream. There were also good elements of friendship, love, being an outsider and not a bland face in the crowd, and such, so it was a well-rounded movie.My rating of "Metal Lords" lands on a seven out of ten stars.
8 I really enjoyed this movie, not just because I like metal but because it speaks of adolescence, of friendship, bullies, virgins, geeks, love and most importantly for me, it includes mental health as a real every day issue. Sweet movie.
9 So if I had to balance this movie in-between 2 spots it would have to be high school drama and metal music. This movie has a taste of both and it is not boring or uninteresting at all. Loved it and will totally see it again, if only for the music. Loved the acting and thought Mr. Martel is coming into his own very well. Cannot wait to see what he is in next!
10 It was almost refreshing!!! A little quirky - but lots of fun. It's not really a children's movie - it's got some mature language and elements to it - but it's fun. It's actually a refreshing change from a lot of the normal dribble! I'm giving it high praise just for being fresh!
8 It's th perfect movie for a weekend evening. It's a bit comedy, a bit drama, a bit teenage angst, a bit romcom and a lot of heavy metal noise. It also includes some great cameos from veteran heavy metal rockers.
10 I've been a metalhead for 30+ years, I've been in bands my youth... This movie hit me so hard, I cried twice. Not exactly because of what was happening on screen, but the sudden rush of memories and the comparison between my life then and now. War Pigs, man, that song also always gets me, metal anthem.The girl, Isis Hainsworth, man what an actress!
9 The 3 kids were great in this. Greensmith as Hunter was fantastic, possessed. Determined at a Metal band beyond all reason and common sense, a natural at comedy. Martell as Schlieb the ultra sincere nerd without a passion until he finds metal and drums. And Hainsworth as Emily the consumate possessed pretty girl in frump frocks that can rock a cello and Olympian javelin throw a clarinet.If this sounds good to you, watch it. I did laughing throughout the show esp. The Crusty the Clown segment...played perfectly by obsessed Greensmith and his plastic surgeon implant fondling laissez faire dad played wonderfully by Gelman.
8 This movie can be fully understood and appreciated only by a true metal fan, especially around fourty years old.The rest of you, wherever you are, just enjoy the film...
10 I thought the writing was excellent and the acting swell and everyone did a great job! Totally fun and cute and sweet all the way around! I can't believe how fun and real and stylistic the thing was! I hope to see more of this! Very cool very fun, Thank-you Mr. Netflix whoemver the people are who get these things in there!
8 Lots of references and nods to Metal and D&D. Captures the trials and tribulations of being a loser at school.Don't try to and analyze and critique this too much.....just solid fun, with some heart. Enjoy!
7 In all honesty this movie starts as a rambling, awkward mess which slowly becomes punctuated by moments of touching brilliance coming out of seemingly nowhere.Shy teenager Kevin traipses through high school all the while being dragged along by his best friend Hunter, whose dreams of becoming a metal god threaten to tear down the very two man band he's built. Together they traverse friendship, love, and most of all what it means to keep everything "Metal".While I was struggling to keep myself engaged in this seemingly flop of a movie, a poignant and well executed turn in the story made me sit up straight in my seat. From there on I was treated to what became an increasingly riveting story with characters that extended beyond the superficial.I was particularly touched with a surprisingly complex character suffering from mental illness, treated with finesse and a level of understanding that I can only surmise comes from real world experience.Overall this movie was not your typical coming of age teen rom com, and you can expect a somewhat sophisticated peek into the lives of teenagers finding their own, messy ways into adulthood and what it ultimately means to find acceptance in yourself and others.HEAVY. METAL. FOREVER!!!
10 More than a decade after School of Rock, I've liked a movie which is as genuine as it can get about rock and metal. This is a great movie for metal and hard rock lovers. Good to hear some legendary metal songs referenced in the movie. Ending is awesome. Machinery of Torment \m/
9 But beware the Justice for all TAB Book is full of mistakes. I sadly learned the record by this book...outschThe story is cool and there are 4 really cool cameos \m/The actors are great and the clichés are NOT exaggerated.
10 Oh god I had so much fun watching this! So awesome!!! Metal!!!!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘
All those who grew up with this music will feel the same!!! I was headbanging like crazy during a teenage netflix movie!!!
10 C'mon...it's a "coming of age" teen movie. Manage your expectations here. That said, I thought it was fun and well executed. The cameos alone are worth the watch. And there was a moment in the movie where I thought "well good for him!" ...Thank you Rob Halford of Judas Priest. All in, if you've got a couple hours to kill, enjoy the last 50 years of of metal, and want to see a positive spin on the genre, give this a shot.
9 Great coming-of-age film, a story of friendship, teenage, love, illness and of course... MUSIC. Very sweet and genuine.It kind of reminded me of Deathgasm (2015), in a way, except without the horror.I will definitely see it again, to experience the character development once more, I thought it was really well done.It's not Oscar material, I get it. But as a musician myself, it's hard not to love a film like this! This is what modern kids should see, in order to get a real opinion of what music really is.
9 Being a rock/metal bassist myslef, I must declare my innate bias in favour of this movie.As a kid who grew up listening to 80s thrash metal, this move resonates very well with me. I loved the soundtrack and the cameos they pulled off for this movie.This film is just like the genre of metal, itself;You either get it. Or you don't.Fans of the genre will enjoy it on at least some level.
10 This made me want to call all my metal head friends from high school & tell them about this movie! It was a great mix of emotion & humor with some EXCELLENT familiar metal hits. I also love a good underdog flick.
9 In a generation of garbage music, it was great to see a high school heavy metal movie. Good story, nice visits from heavy metal royalty, some funny moments, and overall entertaining movie.
6 My initial feeling going into this was that it was going to be like School of Rock. It didn't take long to see that this wasn't going to be the case. Despite it being a completely different movie, it still had all of the makings and opportunity to be just as good. Metal Lords could have and should have been an instant classic. It was not.As with ALL Netflix productions, the budget is there. Therefore the production is top notch. The staffing is top notch. The cinematogrophy is top notch. The music, especially here, was top notch. The writing and pacing? Nowhere to be found. Does Netflix hire tik tokers to write this stuff, or edit it?The three main actors were great for their rolls, but the script was inadequate. I don't blame them.There were moments that were unearned like the drum kit acquisition, the romance between the two leads, the moment of cheating at the wedding party, the invitation and discovery of the cellist, the check in and escape of the recovery center. These all could have been better fleshed out, but they blew through this stuff to make room for a bully, a secondary romantic influence, a mental disorder, and an unrealistic timeline to be prepared for a live show.There was no need for a bully dynamic in this movie, plus it never got resolved. There was no need for the false romantic interest since they had the actual romantic interest between the drummer and cellist.And why, why, why do movies insist on unrealistic timelines? We're not looking for suspense in a rock movie. If they need six months or a year to get ready, let them have that. But not two weeks.I'm not sure what the sideplot with the mental disorder was either. In a different movie, this might have worked. In this movie, it made a monster out of what should have been a great character.The fast lovers dynamic was icky. These are teenagers, right? Is this how they talk and progress into a sexual relationship these days? God help us if this is accurate.I like that the movie did not just try and immitate School of Rock. I like that it attempted to investigate some of these offshoots within the teenager dynamic. I think they played on too many negative aspects painting a bleak picture of what a teenager's life looks like. These were pretty awful teens with completely absent parents.If this movie could have established a point and focused on that point, this could have been a spectacular movie. Unfortunately it dabbled in too many topics and themes and had no identity. The poor characters had no identity.I give it a 6 out of 10 for trying and almost being something good.Maybe one day, Netflix will simply sign the damn checks and stop interfering with artistic liberties. I've seen brand name directors attatched to Netflix Originsls. I know they work together. Let them work.
8 Brought me back to High School... starting a metal was def a lot like this movie. Great fun but also so much drama! This movie was a very enjoyable tale about kids trying to find their way and backed by the power of being different and metal! Will be a classic on my shelf next to my Les Paul Guitar and Marshall Amp.
10 I have been listening to heavy metal since my formative years. And I mostly felt like hardly anyone listens to metal nowadays, nobody appreciates this great genre of music. Previously pop songs also sounded like hair metal, now it doesn't sound the same.I went through similar things through high school and university being a metal head myself. So the 10 star rating is for the way it made me feel.\ /
Keep supporting \m/
6 When outcasts Kevin (Jaeden Martell) and Hunter (Adrian Greensmith) decide enough is enough and are going to become the raddest metal band the world has ever laid eyes on, they discover they have a few problems. First, they need a bass player. Second, they need to win the Battle of the Bands. When they recruit Emily (Isis Hainsworth), who is a cellist, the new trio has now formed an unstoppable trio that is ready to take the world by storm.Director Peter Sollett did a good job of creating a coming-of-age film with the backbone of a Behind the Music feel. You see how the three main characters are faced with life changing incidents and how they overcome them. With DB Weiss on as writer, I wouldn't expect a film like this considering his previous producing credits. The writing and directing teams collaborated to create a film that holds the viewer's attention while flying by.The film's killer soundtrack pushes the narrative throughout. Each song works in unison with what's going on in the film and even blends with the band members' rehearsals. The biggest technical strength is the editing of the music to the instruments. This may even be chalked up to the actors putting in the work to learn the songs. Even if they are stand in musicians, that just shows the editing is doing convincing work to deliver a true rock feel.Jaeden Martell is the workhorse in the film. He carries the dramatic tones of the film while still delivering the comedic beats. Adrian Greensmith has a tough as screws mindset and is the driving comedic force in the film. Isis Hainsworth teeters on the brink of rage, ready to burst at the slightest inconvenience. For me, Joe Manganiello is the highlight of the film. A small role that doesn't overpower the cast but leaves a lasting impression.When you hit the later stages of the second act, this film really drops off. The overall story structure is not breaking any new ground, so you would hope things stay consistent throughout. Thankfully, the film redeems itself and finishes strong with a third act that wraps things up. Some jokes feel forced, and things are done just for the sake of doing them.Metal Lords knows its audience and delivers when it counts. In the age of direct-to-streaming films, you're going to get a lot of films that feel rushed and just put out there. The careful attention to the musical details is what sets this one apart. This is a good way to have a rocking good time with laughs along the way.
7 If you're a metal fan this will give you a few laugh out loud moments but otherwise it's fairly standard high school romcom 'battle of the bands' fare. Inevitably I found myself thinking of Jack Black (school of rock) as the die hard Hunter (Greensmith) incessantly goes into ecstatic monologues about how they will dominate all with their band. The love story plot isn't bad - although, a little 'Grease' with the 'good girl turned bad' trope - but you can't help rising to the theme and going all in as Panteras 'I'm broken' is deployed at just the right moment (enjoy!). Add in some surprise metal guest appearances and a few really well executed slapstick jokes and this is really ok for a few laughs but sadly falls short of the 'file under classic' it might have been.
